/**
 * @elizaos/plugin-app-manager
 *
 * App lifecycle plugin for elizaOS — hosted-app launch / list / close,
 * run-state store, and the `/api/apps/*` route surface.
 *
 * Phase 4G: extracted from `@elizaos/agent` so the runtime package no
 * longer owns hosted-app lifecycle code. The agent re-exports the
 * public surface from its existing api/services barrels during the
 * transition; new callers should import from this package directly.
