/**
 * Side-effect entry point — registers the Relationships view for terminal
 * rendering.
 *
 * In a terminal host (the Node agent, no DOM), register the relationships view
 * so it renders inline in the terminal. Lazy + DOM-guarded so the terminal
 * engine stays out of browser/mobile bundles. Web, iOS, desktop, and Android
 * leave this a no-op (a DOM is present), so the same import is safe everywhere.
