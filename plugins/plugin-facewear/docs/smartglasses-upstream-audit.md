# Smartglasses Upstream Audit

This plugin was built from the gitignored research checkouts under
`research/even-realities/`. The repository root `.gitignore` ignores that
checkout folder, so these upstream repos remain local evidence and are not part
of the committed package.

## Implemented Surface

The upstream review maps to the following local implementation:

- Direct G1 BLE packet protocol and parsing: `src/protocol/smartglasses.ts`
- Eliza service lifecycle, display streaming, mic control, tap handling,
  audio/transcript events, heartbeat, and settings: `src/services/smartglasses-service.ts`
- Eliza actions/providers: `src/actions/*.ts`,
  `src/providers/smartglasses-status.ts`
- Direct BLE transports: `src/transport/web-bluetooth.ts`, `src/transport/noble.ts`
- EvenHub/G2/Mentra bridge transport: `src/transport/even-bridge.ts`
- Mock transport for deterministic Eliza tests: `src/transport/mock.ts`
- Physical validation harnesses:
  - `packages/examples/smartglasses/hardware-smoke.ts`
  - `packages/examples/smartglasses/noble-hardware-smoke.ts`
  - `packages/examples/smartglasses/hardware-evidence.ts`
- Simulator validation harness:
  - `packages/examples/smartglasses/evenhub-smoke.ts`
  - `packages/examples/smartglasses/simulator-automation-smoke.ts`

## Test Coverage

The implementation is covered by:

- `src/__tests__/protocol-smartglasses.test.ts`: packet encoding, pixel-aware display
  wrapping, display chunking, mic commands, tap/audio/serial parsing, settings,
  dashboard position/content, navigation, translation, notifications, notes, voice-note
  list/fetch/delete/delete-all, BMP, heartbeat, init modes, and app whitelist/setup.
- `src/__tests__/facewear-service.test.ts`: Eliza service display streaming, RSVP,
  sequence counters, mic toggle state, side tap behavior, long press/stop
  recording, raw and decoded audio paths, transcript events, startup auto-init,
  heartbeat loop, pre-connected transport listener attachment, and transport
  preference.
- `src/__tests__/functional-parity.test.ts`: exported action/provider/service wiring.
- `src/__tests__/even-bridge.test.ts`: G2/EvenHub/Mentra bridge rendering,
  audio, transcription, and input normalization.
- `src/__tests__/web-bluetooth.test.ts` and `src/__tests__/noble.test.ts`:
  direct BLE lens pairing, UART subscription/write behavior, and notification
  parsing.
- `packages/examples/smartglasses/smartglasses.test.ts`: package example packet
  path plus physical evidence helper requirements.
- `packages/examples/smartglasses/package-smoke.ts`: public package export,
  Eliza event emission, status provider, and action path.

## Remaining Physical Gate

The code includes physical G1 validation paths and direct BLE smoke coverage.
An earlier report from `2026-05-20T06:38:56Z` reached both lenses on the
plugged-in headset and proved whole-headset direct BLE connectivity, serial
response, init/display/settings responses, heartbeats, and right-lens
mic-disable response for serial `S110LABC040019`. It did not complete the
physical gate because that run did not observe a physical-state packet with
`wearing`, so tap and microphone audio evidence could not be observed. The
freshest short Bleak attempt from `2026-05-20T07:42:31Z` did not discover
either lens. CoreBluetooth did discover 36 BLE devices, but zero matched
Even/G1 names and zero advertised the G1 UART service UUID. Both status and
validator output report
`physicalBlocker: "headset_not_found"` for that case, which means the next
Bleak attempt needs both lenses out of the charging base, nearby, advertising,
and worn before the tap/audio validation window. The Bleak raw report also
records `status.connected: false`, service UUID/manufacturer scan inventory,
and the same blocker-aware setup hint when no lenses are found. A Noble attempt from
`2026-05-20T07:26:42Z` failed before scanning because the native Noble BLE
binding is unavailable for the current macOS ARM64 Node/Bun ABI; that path now
writes a report and reports `physicalBlocker: "transport_unavailable"` instead
of silently leaving an older hardware report in place.

Use the root helpers for the next hardware proof attempt:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/examples/smartglasses hardware:prove:bleak:watch
bun run --cwd packages/examples/smartglasses hardware:status-latest
bun run --cwd packages/examples/smartglasses hardware:validate-latest
```

The lower-level package commands remain available when debugging inside the
example:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/examples/smartglasses hardware:prove:bleak
bun run --cwd packages/examples/smartglasses hardware:status-latest
bun run --cwd packages/examples/smartglasses hardware:validate-latest
```

The Noble/Web Bluetooth paths are still available for adapter/browser-specific
checks:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/examples/smartglasses hardware:prove:noble
bun run --cwd packages/examples/smartglasses dev:hardware
```

The required evidence checklist is enforced by
`packages/examples/smartglasses/hardware-evidence.ts`: connected lenses,
connection-ready/init writes, display packets, serial request and response,
settings writes, `wearing` physical state, single-tap mic enable, right-lens
mic-enable write, microphone audio, double-tap mic disable, and right-lens
mic-disable write.

The Bleak/CoreBluetooth proof report also captures macOS Bluetooth preflight
metadata (`bluetoothAdapter` and `pairedG1Devices`) before scanning. That keeps
the latest JSON artifact self-contained when diagnosing the paired-but-not-
advertising state that blocks the physical tap/audio gate.
