# @elizaos/plugin-inmemorydb

Pure in-memory, ephemeral `IDatabaseAdapter` for elizaOS — zero setup, zero persistence, everything gone on `close()`.

## Purpose / role

Provides a complete `DatabaseAdapter` implementation backed by JavaScript `Map` structures and an in-memory HNSW vector index. No disk I/O, no migrations, no configuration required. Load it as a plugin so the runtime registers the adapter automatically, or construct `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter` directly (useful in tests). It is opt-in — the runtime leaves the existing adapter registered if one is already present.

Supported platforms: Node.js and browser (separate build entries in `exports`). Loaded via the `init` hook in `index.ts`.

## Plugin surface

This plugin registers no actions, providers, evaluators, or routes. Its sole contribution is a `DatabaseAdapter`.

| What | Name | Where |
|------|------|--------|
| Plugin object | `plugin` / `default` | `index.ts` |
| Adapter factory | `createDatabaseAdapter(agentId)` | `index.ts` |
| Adapter class | `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter` | `adapter.ts` |
| Storage backend | `MemoryStorage` | `storage-memory.ts` |
| Vector index | `EphemeralHNSW` | `hnsw.ts` |

`init` hook behavior: checks for an existing adapter on the runtime (`r.adapter`, `r.databaseAdapter`, or `r.hasDatabaseAdapter()`); if one is already registered it exits silently. Otherwise it constructs a `MemoryStorage` singleton (keyed by `Symbol.for("elizaos.plugin-inmemorydb.global-singletons")`) and registers a new `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter` for the given `agentId`.

## Layout

```
plugins/plugin-inmemorydb/
  index.ts              Plugin entry — init hook, createDatabaseAdapter(), re-exports
  index.browser.ts      Browser entry — re-exports index.ts (different build target)
  adapter.ts            InMemoryDatabaseAdapter — full IDatabaseAdapter implementation
  storage-memory.ts     MemoryStorage — Map-of-Maps backing store (IStorage)
  hnsw.ts               EphemeralHNSW — cosine-distance HNSW vector index (IVectorStorage)
  types.ts              IStorage, IVectorStorage, VectorSearchResult, COLLECTIONS enum
  generated/specs/      Auto-generated specs (do not hand-edit)
  build.ts              build script (Bun.build + tsc d.ts emit)
  vitest.config.ts      Test config
```

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-inmemorydb build       # compile to dist/
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-inmemorydb dev         # build --watch
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-inmemorydb test        # vitest run

bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-inmemorydb format      # biome format --write
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-inmemorydb clean       # rm -rf dist .turbo .turbo-tsconfig.json *.tsbuildinfo
```

## Config / env vars

None. This plugin reads no environment variables and requires no configuration. The `init` hook receives `config: Record<string, string>` but ignores it entirely.

## How to extend

The plugin exposes `IStorage` (in `types.ts`) as a stable interface. To swap the backing store:

1. Implement `IStorage` (all methods are async).
2. Instantiate `new InMemoryDatabaseAdapter(yourStorage, agentId)` directly instead of going through the plugin's `init` hook.
3. Call `adapter.initialize()` before use.

To add new collection types: add a key to `COLLECTIONS` in `types.ts`, then add CRUD methods to `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter` following the existing pattern (call `this.storage.set/get/getWhere/delete`).

To replace the vector index: implement `IVectorStorage` (in `types.ts`) and pass an instance into the adapter — the adapter currently creates `EphemeralHNSW` in its constructor; a minimal refactor exposes it as a constructor parameter.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **No persistence.** All data is lost when `close()` is called or the process exits. Do not use in production agents that need to remember past interactions.
- **Global singleton storage.** `MemoryStorage` is shared across all adapter instances in the same process via `Symbol.for(...)`. This means multiple agent runtimes in one process share state unless you construct `MemoryStorage` independently.
- **No transaction atomicity.** The `transaction()` method just invokes the callback with `this` — no rollback, no isolation.
- **Default embedding dimension is 384.** Call `adapter.ensureEmbeddingDimension(n)` before writing memories with a different embedding size; it updates the dimension on the HNSW index. Note: calling `init()` on the index only sets the dimension — existing vectors are NOT cleared. Call `clear()` explicitly if you need to discard existing vectors before changing dimension.
- **Batch API only.** Single-item helpers from earlier revisions are removed. All call sites must use batch methods (`createEntities`, `getMemoriesByIds`, etc.).
- **Browser build.** `index.browser.ts` re-exports `index.ts`. The build produces separate `dist/node/` and `dist/browser/` entries; the package `exports` map selects the right one automatically.
- **`node:crypto` dependency.** `adapter.ts` imports `randomUUID` from `node:crypto`. The browser build polyfills this via the build config; do not replace with `Math.random()`.

## ⛔ NON-NEGOTIABLE — evidence, trajectories & real end-to-end tests

> The binding, repo-wide standard is **[PR_EVIDENCE.md](../../PR_EVIDENCE.md)**. Read it.
> Nothing in this package is *done* until it is *proven* done — a reviewer must confirm it
> works **without reading the code**, from the artifacts you attach. This applies to **every**
> feature, fix, refactor, and chore here. "Tests pass" is not proof; "CI is green" is not proof.

- **Record AND read model trajectories.** Capture the *actual* inputs and outputs of the model
  from a **live** LLM — not the deterministic proxy, not a mock: the prompt, the
  providers/context, the raw model output, every tool/action call, and the result. Then **open
  the trajectory and review it by hand.** A captured-but-unread trajectory is not evidence
  (`packages/scenario-runner/bin/eliza-scenarios run <scenario> --report <out>`).
- **Real, full-featured E2E — no larp.** Every feature ships detailed end-to-end tests that
  drive the *real* path end to end. Not the happy "front door" only: cover error paths,
  edge/empty/invalid input, concurrency, roles/permissions, and adversarial input. A test that
  asserts against a mock/stub/fixture standing in for the thing under test **does not count**.
  If the real model/device/chain/connector/account is hard to reach, **make it reachable — that
  is the work**, not an excuse to mock. If the existing tests here are shallow or mocked, fixing
  them is part of your change.
- **Screenshots + logs at every phase**, plus a **complete walkthrough video/run-through** of
  the entire feature or view, start to finish (`bun run test:e2e:record`).
- **Manually review every artifact the change touches** — never just the green check: client
  logs (console + network), server logs (`[ClassName] …`), the model trajectories in and out,
  before/after full-page screenshots, **and the domain artifacts listed below for this package.**
- **No residuals. No shortcuts.** The goal is not "done" — it is *everything* done. Clear every
  blocker by the **hard path**: build the real architecture, stand up the real
  model/device/service, actually test it. Never leave a TODO, a stub, a stepping-stone, or a
  "follow-up." When unsure, research thoroughly, weigh the options, and ship the best,
  highest-effort, production-ready version. Keep going until every possibility is exhausted.

Artifacts → attached inline in the PR (MP4 video, JPG screenshots, logs in `<details>`); attach each evidence type **or**
explicitly mark it N/A with a reason — never leave it blank. If `develop` moved and changed
behavior, **re-capture** evidence; stale proof is worse than none.

**Capture & manually review for this package — storage / memory:**
- The actual rows / embeddings / documents written **and read back**, with their shape inspected — not a mock asserting itself.
- Query correctness: precision/recall on real data, ordering, pagination, and migration up/down.
- GC/retention, concurrency, and large-payload paths.
- A trajectory showing memory/knowledge actually recalled into a turn, where relevant.
