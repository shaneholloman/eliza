/**
 * Binds an orchestrator task to a registered Project from the core project
 * registry (`<stateDir>/projects.json`). A bound task's spawn workdir is
 * derived from the project's `localPath`, so every session of the task targets
 * the same repo — the fix for silent per-session repo drift (#13776).
 *
 * Resolution: an explicit projectId wins; otherwise a resolved spawn workdir is
 * realpath-matched against each registered project's localPath. No match =
 * unbound (undefined), preserving today's per-session workdir re-resolution.
 * Realpath is used on both sides so symlinked / non-canonical paths that point
 * at the same directory still match.
 *
 * Binding also stamps the task's memory world via core's
 * `projectWorldId(agentId, projectId)` — the single, per-agent derivation
 * (#14171): this is the live implementation of #13776 design D3's per-project
 * memory partition, so subagents on project B never see project A's injected
 * context. Worlds are agent-scoped (`World.agentId`), so the world is derived
 * from the runtime's agentId at the service call site (`orchestrator-task-
 * service.ts`); core's helper is the sole source of truth even though
 * `ProjectRecord.worldId` also persists it for CRUD.

 *      beats the first-spawn pin. Not locked: it is still allow-list validated
 *      downstream, and unbound tasks fall through to route resolution.
 *   3. **`boundWorkdir`** — the directory pinned at the task's first spawn, so
 *      follow-up sessions can't silently migrate repos when routing env drifts
 *      between sessions (#13801 / #13776 item 3).
