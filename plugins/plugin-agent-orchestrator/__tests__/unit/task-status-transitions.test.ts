/**
 * Pins the orchestrator's single legal-transition table (#13771). These are
 * pure-function assertions against {@link TASK_STATUS_TRANSITIONS} — the one
 * place that decides which `(from, trigger)` moves are legal — proving the
 * `failed` producer exists (`unrecoverable` edges), that terminal states are
 * immutable to session events, and that illegal transitions throw rather than
 * silently mis-set a status.
