// the runtime route matcher — which requires an exact-segment-count template —
// never reached the bridge over real HTTP. The dispatcher-level test
// (routes-bridge-dispatch.test.ts) could not catch this because it calls the
// dispatcher directly, bypassing the registry. This asserts the registration.
