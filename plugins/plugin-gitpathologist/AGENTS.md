# @elizaos/plugin-gitpathologist

Forensic git-history analysis for Eliza agents: per-surface health timeline, drift inflection detection, and LLM-narrated rot post-mortem.

## Purpose / role

This plugin adds git repository forensics to any Eliza agent running in a Node.js environment. It answers questions like "when did this code get bad?" or "where did rot start in `src/payments/`?" by walking `git log`, scoring each commit, detecting quality inflection points, and optionally calling the agent's configured small-text model to write a narrative explanation.

The plugin is opt-in: the elizaOS agent's plugin collector auto-loads the package when the workspace has a `.git` directory (and the platform is not mobile), unless `ELIZA_GITPATHOLOGIST` overrides that decision. `ELIZA_GITPATHOLOGIST`, `GITPATHOLOGIST_BUDGET`, and `GITPATHOLOGIST_CACHE_DIR` are all declared in the package's `agentConfig.pluginParameters`, but only `GITPATHOLOGIST_BUDGET` and `GITPATHOLOGIST_CACHE_DIR` are read inside this package; `ELIZA_GITPATHOLOGIST` is consumed by the agent runtime's plugin collector. The service itself performs no `.git` detection — `GitPathologyService.start()` registers unconditionally once the package is loaded.

## Plugin surface

| Kind | Name | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Service** | `git_pathology` (`GIT_PATHOLOGY_SERVICE_NAME`) | On-demand analysis orchestrator. Registers the pipeline and cache; all action calls go through it. |
| **Action** | `GIT_PATHOLOGY` | Multiplex action: `action=report` runs a full pathology analysis for a surface path/glob; `action=list` lists cached reports. Similes: `ANALYZE_GIT_PATHOLOGY`, `GIT_HEALTH`, `GIT_FORENSICS`, `PATHOLOGY_REPORT`, `CODE_HISTORY_HEALTH`, `WHERE_DID_ROT_START`. |

No providers, evaluators, routes, or event handlers are registered.

```

## Pipeline (scan → classify → score → inflect → narrate)

1. **scan** — calls `git log --numstat` once for the surface path/glob. No LLM. Returns `RawCommit[]`.
2. **classify** — regex + prefix rules assign `CommitType` and `riskFlags` to each commit. Returns `ClassifiedCommit[]`.
3. **score** — deterministic EMA scoring (α=0.3). Each commit gets a `delta` and running `score`. Reverts targeting commits within the lookback window apply a proximity penalty. Returns `CommitHealthPoint[]`.
4. **inflect** — detects peaks (local EMA maxima) and drift onsets (sustained score drops ≥0.25 over 5 commits). Returns up to 5 peaks and 5 drifts as `InflectionPoint[]`.
5. **narrate** — one `ModelType.TEXT_SMALL` call per drift, capped by `budget`. Fetches `git show` diff snippets (up to 8 KB, scrubbed of secrets) and asks the model to classify a `RotCategory` and write a 2-3 sentence narrative. Falls back to deterministic narration when the runtime has no model or `budget=0`.

Reports are cached by key = `sha256(surface + '\0' + since)`. A cache hit is only valid when the repo HEAD sha matches the stored `headSha`.

## Commands

All scripts require a built `dist/` (run `build` first or use the repo-level turborepo pipeline).

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-gitpathologist build         # Bun.build (ESM + CJS) + tsc declarations
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-gitpathologist test          # vitest run
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-gitpathologist typecheck     # tsgo --noEmit
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-gitpathologist lint          # biome check --write --unsafe
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-gitpathologist lint:check    # biome check (no write)
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-gitpathologist format        # biome format --write
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-gitpathologist format:check  # biome format (no write)
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-gitpathologist clean         # rm dist .turbo
```

## Config / env vars

| Variable | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ELIZA_GITPATHOLOGIST` | boolean | No | auto | Force-enable (`true`) or force-disable (`false`) the plugin. When unset, plugin auto-enables if a `.git` directory is present. |
| `GITPATHOLOGIST_BUDGET` | number | No | `20` | Maximum LLM narration calls per analysis. Set to `0` to run fully deterministic (no model calls). |
| `GITPATHOLOGIST_CACHE_DIR` | string | No | `<repoRoot>/.eliza/gitpathology` | Override the cache directory. Relative paths are resolved against `repoRoot`. |

The action reads `ELIZA_WORKSPACE_DIR` to resolve the repo root when running inside an Eliza agent workspace. Falls back to `process.cwd()` when it is unset.

## How to extend

### Add an action

1. Create `src/actions/<name>.ts` exporting a typed `Action` object.
2. Import it in `src/index.ts` and append it to `gitpathologistPlugin.actions`.
3. Add a test in `__tests__/`.

### Add a pipeline phase

1. Create `src/pipeline/<phase>.ts` with a pure function `(input: PreviousOutput[]) => NextOutput[]`.
2. Call it in `GitPathologyService.runReport()` (`src/services/git-pathology-service.ts`) after the appropriate existing phase.
3. Add or extend types in `src/types.ts` and re-export from `src/index.ts` if callers need the type.

### Add a provider

1. Create `src/providers/<name>.ts` exporting a typed `Provider` object.
2. Import and push into `gitpathologistPlugin.providers` (currently an empty array).

## Conventions / gotchas

- **`git` binary required at runtime.** The scan phase calls `spawnSync("git", ...)` directly. The plugin will fail to start meaningfully in environments without `git` on `PATH`.
- **Node-only.** `exports.node` is the sole distribution target. Do not add browser-compatible code paths.
- **Secret scrubbing is mandatory before LLM calls and cache writes.** `narrate()` runs `scrubSecrets` (string version) over every commit subject and diff snippet before they reach the model prompt; the service runs `scrubSecretsDeep` over the whole `PathologyReport` (including cached reads) before returning or writing to disk. Never bypass either.
- **Cache is HEAD-keyed, not time-keyed.** Any commit to the repo invalidates existing cache entries for that surface. This is intentional.
- **Narrate falls back gracefully.** If the runtime provides no `useModel` function or `budget=0`, `narrate()` uses `deterministicRotCause()` and logs a warning. The report is still valid.
- **No background work.** The service has no timers or subscriptions. Everything is on-demand via `runReport()`.
- **Logging prefix:** `[GitPathologyService]`, `[GitPathology/narrate]`. Use `logger` from `@elizaos/core` for all log output; see root AGENTS.md for the logger-only rule.

## ⛔ NON-NEGOTIABLE — evidence, trajectories & real end-to-end tests

> The binding, repo-wide standard is **[PR_EVIDENCE.md](../../PR_EVIDENCE.md)**. Read it.
> Nothing in this package is *done* until it is *proven* done — a reviewer must confirm it
> works **without reading the code**, from the artifacts you attach. This applies to **every**
> feature, fix, refactor, and chore here. "Tests pass" is not proof; "CI is green" is not proof.

- **Record AND read model trajectories.** Capture the *actual* inputs and outputs of the model
  from a **live** LLM — not the deterministic proxy, not a mock: the prompt, the
  providers/context, the raw model output, every tool/action call, and the result. Then **open
  the trajectory and review it by hand.** A captured-but-unread trajectory is not evidence
  (`packages/scenario-runner/bin/eliza-scenarios run <scenario> --report <out>`).
- **Real, full-featured E2E — no larp.** Every feature ships detailed end-to-end tests that
  drive the *real* path end to end. Not the happy "front door" only: cover error paths,
  edge/empty/invalid input, concurrency, roles/permissions, and adversarial input. A test that
  asserts against a mock/stub/fixture standing in for the thing under test **does not count**.
  If the real model/device/chain/connector/account is hard to reach, **make it reachable — that
  is the work**, not an excuse to mock. If the existing tests here are shallow or mocked, fixing
  them is part of your change.
- **Screenshots + logs at every phase**, plus a **complete walkthrough video/run-through** of
  the entire feature or view, start to finish (`bun run test:e2e:record`).
- **Manually review every artifact the change touches** — never just the green check: client
  logs (console + network), server logs (`[ClassName] …`), the model trajectories in and out,
  before/after full-page screenshots, **and the domain artifacts listed below for this package.**
- **No residuals. No shortcuts.** The goal is not "done" — it is *everything* done. Clear every
  blocker by the **hard path**: build the real architecture, stand up the real
  model/device/service, actually test it. Never leave a TODO, a stub, a stepping-stone, or a
  "follow-up." When unsure, research thoroughly, weigh the options, and ship the best,
  highest-effort, production-ready version. Keep going until every possibility is exhausted.

Artifacts → attached inline in the PR (MP4 video, JPG screenshots, logs in `<details>`); attach each evidence type **or**
explicitly mark it N/A with a reason — never leave it blank. If `develop` moved and changed
behavior, **re-capture** evidence; stale proof is worse than none.

**Capture & manually review for this package — CLI / tooling:**
- The real command/flow invocation transcript (args in, stdout/stderr, exit code) and the artifacts it generated (files, scaffolds, manifests, screenshots/recordings).
- Failure paths: bad args, missing deps, partial state, permission/network errors.
- A recording/log of the actual run end to end — not a unit test of one helper.
- Any model interaction captured as a live trajectory and reviewed.
