/**
 * Audio Broadcast Contracts
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS:
 * These contracts define how audio flows from music-player to consumers (Discord, Web, etc.)
 * without creating dependencies between plugins. This allows:
 *
 * 1. Plugin Independence: music-player doesn't know about Discord, Discord doesn't know
 *    about music-player internals. They communicate through contracts.
 *
 * 2. Multiple Consumers: Multiple outputs (Discord + 5 web listeners) can all receive
 *    the same broadcast independently without affecting each other.
 *
 * 3. Resilience: If Discord disconnects, the broadcast continues. Web listeners are
 *    unaffected. Discord can reconnect and resume from live position.
 *
 * 4. No Radio Dependency: music-player + discord work together without needing the
 *    radio plugin. Radio can add orchestration features, but isn't required.

/**
 * Audio broadcast interface - represents a continuous audio stream
 * that multiple consumers can subscribe to independently.
 *
 * WHY NON-BLOCKING:
 * A slow web listener with a bad connection should NOT cause Discord audio to stutter.
 * Each consumer is isolated - if they can't keep up, we drop their frames, not the source.
 *
 * WHY RESILIENT:
 * Radio stations don't stop broadcasting when everyone changes the channel. Similarly,
 * the broadcast continues even with zero subscribers, so reconnecting is seamless.
 *
 * WHY LIVE:
 * When Discord reconnects after a hiccup, it should hear what's playing NOW, not
 * buffered audio from 10 seconds ago. This is radio-style, not recording-style.
 *
 * Implementations must ensure:
 * - Non-blocking: slow consumers don't affect the broadcast or other consumers
 * - Resilient: broadcast continues even if all consumers disconnect
 * - Live: new subscribers get current audio, not buffered past audio
