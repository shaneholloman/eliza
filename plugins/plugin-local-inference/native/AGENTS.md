# AGENTS.md — Eliza-1 inference (kernels + runtime)

This file is the canonical contract for any agent working on the Eliza-1
on-device inference stack. In this repository the native stack lives under
`plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/`; older docs may still call that area
`packages/inference/`. The contract also applies to the local-inference runtime
surfaces in `packages/ui/src/services/local-inference/`, the mtp build hook at
`packages/app-core/scripts/build-llama-cpp-mtp.mjs`, and any mobile/desktop
bridges that consume the same artifacts.

The training-side companion is at [`packages/training/AGENTS.md`](../../../packages/training/AGENTS.md).
Read both before changing anything that crosses the boundary (artifacts,
manifest, kernel ABI, GGML pin).

**Fork source.** The patched llama.cpp ships in-tree as a git submodule at
[`plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/llama.cpp`](llama.cpp) — `elizaOS/llama.cpp`
tracking the `v1.2.0-eliza` line (resolve the current gitlink via
`git -C plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/llama.cpp describe --always`; the
`v1.0.0-eliza` / `08032d57` pin documented previously is **stale** — do not copy
that pin into new tooling or scripts). `git submodule update --init --recursive`
(which `bun install` runs) is the canonical checkout. This is the canonical fork:
TurboQuant (turbo3/turbo4/turbo3_tcq) + QJL
(`block_qjl1_256`, `GGML_OP_ATTN_SCORE_QJL`, `GGML_OP_FUSED_ATTN_QJL_TBQ`) +
PolarQuant (`block_q4_polar`, `Q4_POLAR=47`) + the eliza Metal/Vulkan/CUDA
kernels + MTP spec-decode (`--spec-type mtp`, the `mtp-draft` GGUF arch)
+ the post-refactor `llama-server` (`server-task.cpp` / `server-common.cpp` with
`grammar_lazy` / `json_schema` / `response_format` / `prefill_assistant`), on
upstream b9213. Both build paths consume it: `build-llama-cpp-mtp.mjs`
(desktop/server/Windows/iOS) and `aosp/compile-libllama.mjs` (Android) default to
the submodule checkout. `ELIZA_MTP_LLAMA_CPP_REMOTE` / `_REF` (or `--cache-dir`
/ `--src-dir`) still force a standalone clone for fork bisects. (The `v1.2.0-eliza`
line tracks the prior `v1.0.0-eliza` tree forward, re-tagged on the elizaOS rename
chain. A full rebase onto a recent upstream llama.cpp remains a **deferred**
follow-up — not a blocker for structured output (the b9213 base already has
`grammar_lazy` / `json_schema` / `response_format` / `prefill_assistant`); the
conflict-prone files are the quant-slot enums in `ggml-common.h` / `ggml.h` and
the `Q1_0` block layout, which upstream redefined incompatibly with the fork's.
Before attempting that rebase, write or update a concrete porting plan in the
repo docs and verify every referenced path from this directory.)

## 1. What we are building

**Eliza-1** is a single product line of on-device fused models. From the
user's perspective there is exactly one default option per device tier;
they pick a size, they get one bundle, it does text + voice + vision.
Underneath it is a manifest-described bundle of GGUF/metallib/SPIR-V
files plus kernel capability metadata. There is no "pick the text model"
or "pick the TTS" — that is a runtime concern, not a user concern.

Backbones (do not change without explicit human approval):

- **Text/vision:** Gemma 4 family (E2B/E4B/12B/31B) for the
  2B/4B/9B/27B release tiers. Gemma is a dense SWA + shared-KV + PLE + MQA
  architecture with dual head dims (512 global / 256 swa); the legacy
  QJL/PolarQuant/TurboQuant KV kernels are head_dim=128 and are NOT
  required for Gemma (its KV is already minimal) — TurboQuant weight-quant
  still applies. Every active Eliza-1 tier is vision-capable when its
  tier-matched `vision/mmproj-<tier>.gguf` is present and validated. We do
  not name these as "Gemma" in any user-facing string. Internally,
  manifests record the upstream lineage and license; the UI shows
  "Eliza-1 <tier>".
- **Voice (TTS):** Tier-aware. The active backend per tier is declared
  in `ELIZA_1_VOICE_BACKENDS`
  (`packages/shared/src/local-inference/catalog.ts`) and is read by the
  runtime selector at engine arm time. Policy:

  | Tier                  | Backend(s)              | Default  |
  | --------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
  | `2b` / `4b`           | OmniVoice **and** Kokoro| OmniVoice|
  | `9b`                  | OmniVoice **and** Kokoro| OmniVoice|
  | `27b` / `27b-256k` | OmniVoice only  | OmniVoice|

  - **Kokoro** = Kokoro-82M GGUF staged from `elizaos/eliza-1`
    (original `hexgrad/Kokoro-82M`, Q4_K_M). Fixed voice packs, no per-user
    cloning. Bundled at
    `tts/kokoro/{kokoro-82m-v1_0-Q4_K_M.gguf,tokenizer.json,voices/<voice>.bin}`
    in each shipping tier. Backend implementation:
    `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/kokoro/`.
  - **OmniVoice** = Qwen3-TTS lineage. Upstream at
    `https://github.com/ServeurpersoCom/omnivoice.cpp`, mirrored at
    `https://github.com/elizaOS/omnivoice.cpp`. ~200ms TTFB on the
    fused build. Per-user voice cloning, voice design via attribute
    keywords, optional `omnivoice-singing` variant
    (`[singing]/[happy]/[sad]/[whisper]/[angry]/[nervous]/[calm]/
    [excited]` + non-verbals `[laughter]/[sigh]`). Bundled at
    `tts/omnivoice-base-<quant>.gguf` + `tts/omnivoice-tokenizer-<quant>.gguf`
    in tiers that ship it.

  Per Wave-6 user direction (2026-05-10), omnivoice-singing CAN ship as
  part of default bundles for non-commercial use (CC-compatible terms).
  Commercial pivot requires re-training on commercially-licensed corpora
  to clear the CC-BY-NC-SA training-data lineage (GTSinger, RAVDESS,
  Expresso).

  **Canonical voice engine: fused `libelizainference`.** The strategic
  on-device voice engine is the fused-FFI `libelizainference` library
  built directly from the merged llama.cpp fork tree at
  `plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/llama.cpp/tools/omnivoice/`.
  This is what `services/voice/` calls; this is what the manifest's
  `voice` and `asr` entries are activated through.

  **W3-3 (OmniVoice → llama.cpp literal merge, v1.0.1-eliza, 2026-05-14):**
  the OmniVoice sources, FFI bridge, and streaming optimizations now
  live INSIDE the fork at `tools/omnivoice/`. The pre-merge graft path
  (clone `elizaOS/omnivoice.cpp` at build time, copy sources into
  `omnivoice/` at fork root, append `ELIZA-OMNIVOICE-FUSION-GRAFT-V1`
  CMake block via `packages/app-core/scripts/omnivoice-fuse/` —
  driven by `ELIZA_FUSE_OMNIVOICE=ON`) is **deprecated** and stays for
  ONE release as a runway. Setting `OMNIVOICE_INSIDE_LLAMA_CPP=0`
  (build-script env) opts back into the legacy graft. The default is
  the merged path (`OMNIVOICE_INSIDE_LLAMA_CPP=1`). The build flag is
  now `-DLLAMA_BUILD_OMNIVOICE=ON -DOMNIVOICE_SHARED=ON`;
  `ELIZA_FUSE_OMNIVOICE=ON` is a back-compat alias that emits a
  deprecation warning and redirects.

  After the v1.0.2-eliza release, `OMNIVOICE_INSIDE_LLAMA_CPP=0` is
  removed and `packages/app-core/scripts/omnivoice-fuse/` is deleted.

  The standalone OmniVoice backend (separate ABI v2 `ov_*` symbols,
  separate `libomnivoice.{so,dylib,dll}`, separate build script
  `native/build-omnivoice.mjs`) is **legacy**; the standalone plugin that
  once wrapped it has been removed. Do not add a new standalone wrapper;
  new voice code goes through `libelizainference`.

  Kokoro and OmniVoice both satisfy the same `TtsBackend +
  StreamingTtsBackend` contract — the runtime selector
  (`services/voice/kokoro/runtime-selection.ts`) picks one at arm time
  based on the tier policy, the `ELIZA_TTS_BACKEND` env override
  (`kokoro|omnivoice|auto`), voice-cloning requirements, and measured
  RTF / TTFB.

- **ASR:** Local ASR is fused-FFI only and artifact-gated. A
  default-eligible Gemma 4 release must record real Gemma ASR lineage
  in the manifest and must not ship Qwen ASR provenance; the runtime and
  manifest validator reject strict/defaultEligible Qwen ASR stand-ins.
  Bundled files remain `asr/eliza-1-asr.gguf` +
  `asr/eliza-1-asr-mmproj.gguf` (mmproj sidecar is REQUIRED for the
  audio-in / text-out path). Activated through `libelizainference`'s
  `eliza_pick_asr_files()`. The public Qwen3-ASR artifacts and the
  `qwen3a` mtmd backport are compatibility/scaffolding only until
  verified Gemma ASR artifacts are staged; do not expose them as
  default/recommended. OmniVoice has no ASR head — do not route ASR
  through it.

  whisper.cpp is **not** in the contract — it vendors its own ggml,
  violating the one-llama.cpp-build / one-GGML-pin contract in §4.
  All historical `transcribeManager.ts` / `whisper-node` references
  have been removed.
- **VAD:** Silero VAD (MIT, ~2 MB ONNX). Ships in every voice-enabled
  bundle. Drives barge-in cancellation; gates ASR to skip silent frames.
- **Wake word:** openWakeWord (Apache-2.0, ~3 MB). Opt-in, local-mode
  only. Hidden in cloud mode per three-mode hide-not-disable.
- **Embedding:** `2b` (the entry tier) reuses the active text backbone with
  `--pooling last` — no duplicate weights in the mobile/default tier.
  Larger tiers may ship a dedicated `embedding/` artifact (1024-dim
  Matryoshka, 32k ctx) when the manifest records a real source artifact and
  evidence. Do not fabricate embedding source repos, and do not silently
  fall back on larger tiers when the manifest says a dedicated region is
  required.
- **Drafter:** MTP ships on every tier, including the `2b` entry tier.
  Speculative decoding is mandatory, not optional (see §3).

Three runtime modes — every code path must work in all three:

| Mode      | Local models? | Cloud models? | Remote control? |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| `local`   | yes (default) | optional      | exposes itself  |
| `cloud`   | hidden        | yes (default) | hidden          |
| `remote`  | via target    | no            | yes             |

Settings rules (enforce in UI + API layer, not just docs):
- `cloud` mode hides every local-model UI surface, every
  `ELIZA_LOCAL_*` setting, and the local-inference settings panel
  entirely. The cloud setting page is the only model-related surface.
- `local-only` mode (a sub-state of `local`) hides every cloud setting
  and every cloud-routed provider. The user must not be able to
  accidentally route a request to cloud.
- `remote` mode connects to a *local* instance only. It must refuse to
  point at a cloud instance. Changing cloud settings in remote mode
  mutates the *target's* cloud settings (i.e. the local agent the
  remote is controlling), not the remote-control client.

These three modes are not feature flags or A/B variants. They are the
top-level shape of the product. New code that adds a model surface MUST
state explicitly which modes it lives in, and MUST be removed from
modes where it does not belong.

---

## 2. Single fused bundle per device tier

Eliza-1 ships as **one logical bundle per tier**. The user sees one
download. Internally a bundle is a manifest plus several files, all
hosted under the `elizalabs` HuggingFace org under `eliza-1`.

### Tier matrix (binding)

| Tier            | Tagline                       | Text  | Voice           | Vision | Context  | MTP | Quant default                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----- | --------------- | ------ | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `2b`         | small / low-RAM phones (entry) | 2B    | OmniVoice + Kokoro | mmproj | 128k  | yes    | TurboQuant Q4 + stock Gemma KV  |
| `4b`         | flagship phones, small desktops| 4B    | OmniVoice + Kokoro | mmproj | 128k  | yes    | TurboQuant Q4 + stock Gemma KV  |
| `9b`         | desktop / midrange GPU          | 9B    | OmniVoice + Kokoro | mmproj | 128k  | yes    | TurboQuant Q4 + stock Gemma KV  |
| `27b`        | flagship GPU                    | 27B   | OmniVoice       | mmproj | 128k     | yes    | TurboQuant Q4 + turbo3_tcq      |
| `27b-256k`  | long-context flagship            | 27B   | OmniVoice       | mmproj | 256k     | yes    | + turbo3_tcq (long ctx)         |

> pins this contract.

Context-length variants (32k / 64k / 128k / 256k) are *not* separate
tiers — they are dimensions inside a tier. A tier's manifest lists which
context lengths are available; the runtime picks the largest that fits
the device's RAM budget at activation time.

### Bundle layout (binding)

All tiers ship in a single HuggingFace mono-repo `elizaos/eliza-1`, with
each tier living under `bundles/<tier>/`. The manifest is the source of
truth; never derive contents from filenames.

```
elizaos/eliza-1/

```

The **runtime default** voice quant per tier (the level the runtime
selects when no device-class override applies) is the value returned by
`voiceQuantForTier()` in `packages/shared/src/local-inference/catalog.ts`:
`Q4_K_M` for `2b/4b`, `Q8_0` for `9b/27b/27b-256k`.

The **publish ladder** per tier (every level that gets staged when
`--include-voice-ladder` is passed) is the value returned by
`voiceQuantLadderForTier()`:

- Mobile tiers (`2b/4b`) publish the narrow OmniVoice ladder
  `Q3_K_M, Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M`.
- Larger OmniVoice-shipping tiers (`9b/27b/27b-256k`) publish
  `Q3_K_M, Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M, Q6_K, Q8_0`.

The downloader picks the level matching the host's memory class at
install time (MAX / GOOD / OKAY / POOR per `memory-budget.ts`).
**No silent fallback** — §3 forbids "try the next smaller one" at
runtime; if the resolved level isn't in the bundle, the install fails
loudly with an actionable diagnostic.

#### OmniVoice quant rules (per R6 §5.6 + R8 §2)

- **K-quant ladder Q3..Q8** — applies. `omnivoice.cpp/tools/quantize.cpp`
  already supports the full Q2_K..Q8_0 set; the curated publish subset is
  the ladder above.
- **PolarQuant on the LM weight bank** — *applies* (OmniVoice's LM head
  is Qwen3-shaped), but no recipe is wired yet. Landing this requires
  either grafting `Q4_POLAR` recognition into OmniVoice's loader via
  `omnivoice-fuse/cmake-graft.mjs`, or running PolarQuant before
  `omnivoice.cpp/convert.py`. Gated on a measured TTS-MOS comparison.
- **V-cache PolarQuant** — **N/A**. OmniVoice has no KV cache between
  MaskGIT steps; there's no V-cache to compress.
- **QJL** — *conditional, deferred*. Only matters for long-form
  multi-chunk synth where the cumulative cache becomes large. Off the
  Wave-2 critical path.
- **TurboQuant V-cache** — same applicability as QJL — N/A absent a KV
  cache.

A literal single `.gguf` containing all of text + voice + ASR + vision
+ drafter is **not** the deliverable — that requires either a custom
container format or major upstream work in llama.cpp's GGUF graph, and
is explicitly out of scope until the bundle ships and is stable. The
single user-visible *download action* IS the deliverable: one click,
one progress bar, one bundle on disk.

If that constraint changes (i.e. someone wants a literal one-file
artifact later), define an `.eliza` container format with a manifest +
multiple GGUFs concatenated, and update §6 — do not silently change the
GGUF schema.

---

## 3. Mandatory optimizations (never skip, error if missing)

Every Eliza-1 bundle MUST run through every applicable optimization.
The runtime MUST refuse to load a bundle that is missing any required
artifact for its tier. There is no "fast path that skips X" and no
"fallback to unoptimized". A bundle that cannot satisfy the contract
must be marked broken in `eliza-1.manifest.json` and not served from
the recommended-models endpoint.

**Gemma 4 exception.** For Gemma 4 tiers the mandatory set is TurboQuant
(weight-quant) + MTP + the Gemma-native SWA/shared-KV/PLE memory settings
(`swa_full=false`, bounded ctx-checkpoints, mmap-on, Per-Layer-Embeddings
pinned to CPU on GPU backends). Because Gemma's KV is already minimal
(MQA + windowed-SWA + shared-KV), the head_dim=128 QJL/PolarQuant KV
kernels are **optional** on Gemma rather than required — "must run every
kernel" below applies to the legacy Qwen-shaped tiers, not Gemma's KV.

### Required for ALL tiers

1. **TurboQuant** on the text model. Q3 for `lite`, Q3/Q4 for `mobile`,
   Q4 for `desktop`/`pro`/`server`. The KV cache MUST use TurboQuant Q3
   or Q4 quantization. See `vulkan/turbo3.comp`, `vulkan/turbo4.comp`,
   `vulkan/turbo3_tcq.comp`, `metal/turbo3.metal`, `metal/turbo4.metal`,
   `metal/turbo3_tcq.metal`. Verification: `verify/metal_verify` and
   `verify/vulkan_verify` MUST report 8/8 PASS on the target backend
   for the bundle's `dtype` before publish.
2. **QJL** on the K-cache when context > 8k. See `vulkan/qjl*.comp` and
   `metal/qjl.metal`. The reference is `packages/native/plugins/qjl-cpu`.
3. **PolarQuant** on the V-cache when context > 8k. See `vulkan/polar*.comp`
   and `metal/polar.metal`. The reference is
   `packages/native/plugins/polarquant-cpu`.
4. **MTP speculative decoding** with the bundle's drafter. Always wired,
   always running in voice mode. The MTP drafter participates in voice
   generation — proposed text tokens that survive verification are
   immediately handed to the TTS pipeline; rejected tokens roll back the
   TTS chunker (see §4 for the streaming contract).
5. **Fused kernels.** TurboQuant + QJL + Polar must compile into the same
   shipped llama.cpp build via the patch hooks in
   `packages/app-core/scripts/build-llama-cpp-mtp.mjs`. The runtime
   MUST log the kernel set on startup; missing kernels = startup error.

### Required for `desktop`/`pro`/`server` tiers

6. **TCQ trellis-coded quantization** for desktop/pro/server and any
   long-context text variant. `turbo3_tcq.comp` / `turbo3_tcq.metal`.
7. **CPU-offloaded KV cache** for context > 64k where device RAM is
   insufficient. The runtime MUST implement spill, not just refuse the
   request.

### Failure handling

If a required kernel fails to load, fails verification, or is missing
from the build:

- **Build time:** `build-llama-cpp-mtp.mjs` MUST exit non-zero, and
  the published artifact MUST NOT include a "kernels-missing" fallback
  build. There is no fallback build.
- **Runtime:** the engine MUST refuse to activate the bundle and surface
  a structured error to the UI. It MUST NOT silently fall back to
  unoptimized inference. It MUST NOT log-and-continue.

The Metal and Vulkan kernel patchers run unconditionally for matching
build targets. Build outputs can record shipped shader symbols
separately from runtime-ready graph dispatch, but only runtime-ready
capabilities may satisfy this contract. Treat any builder/runtime that
disables a required patch as broken.

---

## 4. Fused pipeline (mic → speech, end-to-end)

The streaming contract for voice mode. Every Eliza-1 runtime MUST
implement this exact graph; integrations that need a subset (e.g.
text-only) must reach the same nodes via the same scheduler, not via a
parallel codepath.

```
mic / file → ASR → text tokens
                    ↓
                  scheduler ──→ MTP drafter (proposes N tokens)
                                       ↓
                                  target verifier (text model)
                                       ↓
                              accepted tokens → phrase chunker
                                       ↓                       ↘
                            speaker preset (cached)        rollback queue
                                       ↓                       ↙
                                  OmniVoice TTS  ←── on-reject: cancel chunk
                                       ↓
                                  PCM ring buffer → audio out
```

### Hard requirements

- **One process, one llama.cpp build, one GGML pin.** Text and voice
  share the same llama.cpp library. omnivoice.cpp is fused into the
  same build at the source level (vendored, not a sidecar). If the
  GGML version pin used by omnivoice.cpp diverges from the text model,
  the build MUST fail.
- **Shared KV cache scheduling, not shared KV memory.** Text and voice
  have their own KV caches (different layer counts, different head
  configs, different quantizations). What they share is the scheduler,
  the mmap region for weights, the kernel set, and the memory-budget
  policy.
- **Streaming handoff.** When MTP + target produce an accepted
  text token, the phrase chunker MUST hand the chunk to TTS within the
  same scheduler tick — no buffering past phrase boundaries. Phrase
  boundaries are punctuation + a max-N-token cap (configurable per
  tier).
- **Barge-in cancellation.** When the mic detects new user speech, the
  TTS PCM ring buffer MUST drain immediately, the phrase chunker queue
  MUST flush, and any in-flight TTS forward pass MUST be cancelled at
  the next kernel boundary.
- **Voice cancellation contract (W3-9).** One `VoiceCancellationToken`
  per voice turn is the canonical handle. It lives in
  `@elizaos/shared/voice/voice-cancellation-token`, is owned by the
  `VoiceCancellationCoordinator` in
  `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/cancellation-coordinator.ts`,
  and is the sole legitimate way to fan an abort across these four
  layers:
  1. The runtime's `TurnControllerRegistry.abortTurn(roomId, reason)`
     so the planner-loop / action handlers / streaming `useModel`
     calls see the abort within one tick.
  2. The LM slot — via the registered `slotAbort(slotId, reason)`
     callback (today: HTTP-fetch close on the in-flight stream; on a
     fork that exposes a slot-cancel REST route, the REST call).
  3. The TTS pipeline — via the registered `ttsStop(reason)` callback
     (today: `EngineVoiceBridge.triggerBargeIn` → audio-sink drain +
     FFI/HTTP synthesis cancel).
  4. Any fetch / model / FFI consumer of `token.signal` (a standard
     `AbortSignal`).
  The token is idempotent (first reason wins) and fires every
  `onAbort` listener synchronously. Optimistic LM start is gated by
  `OptimisticGenerationPolicy` — default true on plugged-in /
  unknown, false on battery, with explicit user override.
  Full contract: `plugins/plugin-local-inference/docs/voice-cancellation-contract.md`.
- **Speaker preset caching.** The default voice ships as a precomputed
  speaker embedding in `cache/voice-preset-default.bin`. Loading a
  voice MUST NOT re-extract the embedding from raw audio on every
  startup. A precomputed phrase cache for common assistant utterances
  ("Sure.", "One moment.", "I can't help with that.") MUST be used as
  a first-byte-latency win.
- **MTP↔TTS coupling.** When MTP proposes text tokens that are
  later rejected by the target, the TTS chunker's rollback queue MUST
  drop the corresponding (not-yet-spoken) audio chunks. Audio that has
  already left the ring buffer is gone — design the chunker so this is
  rare (small chunk = low latency cost on rollback).

### What we do NOT do

- We do not run text and voice in two processes communicating over IPC.
  That regresses memory and adds a 1–10ms scheduling tax per turn.
- We do not run a "TTS-only mode" that skips MTP. MTP is always
  on. If the user disables speculative decoding for debugging, that is
  a developer-only flag (`ELIZA_MTP_DISABLE=1`), it is not a user
  setting, and it MUST log a loud warning every turn.
- We do not split voice into "fast TTS" and "high-quality TTS" tiers.
  One voice model per tier, fused, optimized.

## 5. Three modes — code organization

Every entry point that touches a model MUST be classified into one or
more of `local`, `cloud`, `remote`. The classification lives in code,
not in docs.

- `packages/app-core/src/services/local-inference/` is the `local` and
  `local-only` surface. It MUST have a hard import boundary against
  cloud-only modules.
- Cloud-routing code is in the cloud package and MUST NOT be imported
  by the local-inference service except through a typed mode-aware
  router that the runtime mode gates.
- `remote` mode is implemented as a thin client over the local
  instance's HTTP API. It does NOT have its own model surfaces — every
  setting it changes maps to a setting on the target.

Hide-not-disable rule: when a mode hides a setting, the UI must omit
the surface entirely, the API must reject mutations to that setting
with a 4xx, and the persisted setting must be inert (no background job
acts on it). "Hidden" without "inert" is a leak.

---

## 6. Manifest schema (binding)

`eliza-1.manifest.json` is the source of truth for every Eliza-1
bundle. The runtime, the recommendation engine, the downloader, the
mobile catalogs, and the build script all read this file. Do not let
catalogs drift from it — generate them.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://elizaos.ai/schemas/eliza-1.manifest.v1.json",
  "id": "eliza-1-4b",
  "tier": "4b",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "publishedAt": "2026-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "lineage": {
    "text": { "base": "gemma-4-E4B", "license": "..." },
    "voice": { "base": "omnivoice-base-Q4_K_M", "license": "..." },
    "drafter": { "base": "mtp-4b-drafter", "license": "..." }
  },
  "files": {
    "text":    [{ "path": "text/eliza-1-4b-128k.gguf", "ctx": 131072, "sha256": "..." }],
    "voice":   [{ "path": "tts/omnivoice-base-Q4_K_M.gguf",   "sha256": "..." }],
    "asr":     [{ "path": "asr/...",                          "sha256": "..." }],
    "vision":  [{ "path": "vision/mmproj-4b.gguf",    "sha256": "..." }],
    "mtp":  [{ "path": "mtp/drafter-4b.gguf",   "sha256": "..." }],
    "cache":   [{ "path": "cache/voice-preset-default.bin",   "sha256": "..." }]
  },
  "kernels": {
    "required": ["turboquant_q4", "qjl", "polarquant", "mtp", "turbo3_tcq"],
    "optional": [],
    "verifiedBackends": {
      "metal":  { "status": "pass", "atCommit": "...", "report": "..." },
      "vulkan": { "status": "pass", "atCommit": "...", "report": "..." },
      "cuda":   { "status": "pass", "atCommit": "...", "report": "..." },
      "cpu":    { "status": "pass", "atCommit": "...", "report": "..." }
    }
  },
  "evals": {
    "textEval":      { "score": 0.0, "passed": true },
    "voiceRtf":      { "rtf": 0.0,   "passed": true },
    "e2eLoopOk":     true,
    "thirtyTurnOk":  true
  },
  "ramBudgetMb": { "min": 7000, "recommended": 9500 },
  "defaultEligible": true
}
```

**Rules:**

- Every published bundle MUST have `defaultEligible: true` only if every
  required kernel is verified on every supported backend for that tier
  AND every eval has `passed: true`. The recommendation engine MUST
  refuse to surface a bundle with `defaultEligible: false` as a default.
- HF-search results from outside `elizaos/eliza-1` MUST never set
  `defaultEligible: true`. They are user-installed customs only.
- The runtime MUST validate the manifest against `kernels.required`
  before activating the bundle. A capability mismatch is a hard error.

## 7. HuggingFace publishing & auto-download

Every Eliza-1 release lives at `https://huggingface.co/elizaos`. The
device-side downloader MUST:

1. Read the manifest from the bundle's repo before downloading any
   weight file. Verify schema version, kernel caps against the device,
   RAM budget against device hardware. Refuse incompatible bundles
   with a structured error.
2. Download every file in `manifest.files.*`. Verify `sha256` for each.
   Resume on partial download.
3. Check the device's available kernels (Metal/Vulkan/CUDA/CPU/MLX/NEON)
   against `manifest.kernels.required`. If any required kernel is
   unavailable on this device, the download MUST be aborted with a
   structured error before any weight bytes are fetched. There is no
   "download anyway, hope it works" path.
4. Materialize the bundle to the local cache, run a one-time
   verify-on-device pass (load → 1-token text generation → 1-phrase
   voice generation → barge-in cancel test), and only then mark the
   bundle `ready` in the local catalog.

Publishing flow (training side, see [`packages/training/AGENTS.md`](../../../packages/training/AGENTS.md)):

- Training produces text + drafter weights.
- Quantization recipes in `packages/training/scripts/quantization/`
  apply TurboQuant + QJL + Polar.
- A publish script (one of the `publish_*` scripts in
  `packages/training/scripts/`) assembles the bundle, generates the
  manifest, runs `verify/metal_verify` + `verify/vulkan_verify` against
  the bundle's quantized artifacts, populates `kernels.verifiedBackends`,
  runs the eval suite, and pushes to HF.
- The publish script MUST refuse to upload if any required eval fails
  or any required kernel is unverified.

---

## 8. Verification gates (what "done" means)

A bundle is shippable when, on each supported backend:

- `make -C plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/verify reference-test` is clean.
- `verify/metal_verify` reports 8/8 PASS for `turbo3`, `turbo4`,
  `turbo3_tcq`, `qjl`, `polar` against the bundle's quantized weights
  (not just synthetic fixtures — fixtures regenerated from the actual
  shipped weights).
- `verify/vulkan_verify` reports 8/8 PASS for the same set.
- The CUDA path (where applicable) reproduces the same outputs to the
  same numerical tolerance.
- A 30-turn end-to-end voice loop runs without crash, without leak,
  without exceeding `manifest.ramBudgetMb.recommended`.
- First-token latency, first-audio latency, RTF, ASR WER, peak RSS,
  thermal/battery (mobile), and MTP acceptance rate are recorded
  in the manifest's `evals` block and meet tier-specific gates.

A code change that touches kernels, the build script, the mtp
server, or the bundled-models catalog MUST run the relevant subset of
these gates locally before merge. CI runs the full set per supported
backend nightly.

---

## 9. Working style

- **Scope discipline.** The kernels in this directory are a contract.
  Do not invent new quantization formats, new fusion graphs, or new
  KV-cache layouts without a written design doc that explains why the
  existing five (`turbo3`, `turbo4`, `turbo3_tcq`, `qjl`, `polar`) are
  insufficient.
- **No defensive code.** A missing kernel, a missing manifest field,
  or a verification failure is a hard error. Do not add fallbacks. Do
  not log-and-continue. The whole point of the contract is that we
  ship one optimized path, not three with conditional branches.
- **Mirror the references bit-for-bit.** Metal/Vulkan kernels MUST
  produce numerically identical output (within published tolerance) to
  the C reference in `plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/reference/` and to the
  upstream CUDA implementation in
  `packages/native/plugins/{qjl-cpu,polarquant-cpu}` and the `elizaOS/llama.cpp`
  fork. New kernels follow the same pattern: ship the C reference and
  a JSON fixture before shipping the Vulkan/Metal port.
- **Hardware verification is non-optional.** A "compiles cleanly"
  badge is not a "passes" badge. The README's verification matrix
  marks rows as `NEEDS HARDWARE` until `metal_verify` / `vulkan_verify`
  reports 8/8 on a real device. Do not flip a row to ✓ without that
  evidence.
- **Stay aligned with the training side.** Quantization recipes, weight
  layouts, and bundle structure cross the boundary between training
  and inference. Read [`packages/training/AGENTS.md`](../../../packages/training/AGENTS.md)
  before changing the manifest schema or any quantization op.
- **Branding.** User-facing strings and logs say `Eliza-1`. They do
  not say `Qwen`, `Llama`, `OmniVoice`, `MTP`, or `TurboQuant`.
  Internal logs, stack traces, and developer-mode UI surfaces may
  reference upstream names — anywhere a user can see, the name is
  Eliza-1.

## 10. Files to read before making changes

- `plugins/plugin-local-inference/README.md` — plugin-level runtime and native
  inference overview.
- `packages/ui/src/services/local-inference/README.md` — runtime
  contract for the engine, downloader, recommendation, and routing.
- `packages/app-core/scripts/build-llama-cpp-mtp.mjs` — the build
  hook. Every kernel patch lives here. It (and the AOSP cross-compile at
  `packages/app-core/scripts/aosp/compile-libllama.mjs`) default to building
  from the in-repo `plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/llama.cpp` submodule.
- `packages/training/AGENTS.md` — the training-side contract, including
  what the bundle/publish flow expects.
- the repo-root `AGENTS.md` — repo-wide cleanup mandate and conventions
  (port handling, scope discipline, elizaOS naming). The non-negotiable
  architecture rules apply here too: dependencies point inward, no
  polymorphism for runtime branching in code (kernels are a registry,
  not an `if`), no `try/catch` that swallows.

---

## 11. ONNX deprecation status (updated Kokoro GGUF, 2026-06-25)

**Single on-device runtime: ONE managed library (`libelizainference`), ONE
pipe, no sidecar/subprocess/TCP. No ONNX anywhere in the resolved code path:
`onnxruntime-node`/`onnxruntime-web` is not a dependency and there are zero live
imports in `plugin-local-inference/src` (enforced by
`src/services/voice/onnx-import-ban.test.ts`). VAD, wake-word, turn-detector
(preferred), Kokoro (fused GGUF), OmniVoice, and ASR all resolve through the
fork FFI. The three voice classifier heads (Wav2Small emotion, WeSpeaker,
pyannote-3) have already dropped ONNX too — but see the emotion-classifier gap
called out below: the ONNX runtime was removed before the native GGUF read was
wired, so the acoustic emotion read is DEAD at runtime (nothing loads a
`files.emotion` GGUF; the fusion runs text/prosody-only) — a tracked K1
follow-up, not a silent fallback hidden behind a stub.**

**Single runtime policy:** every local-inference model path must flow through
ONE managed library (`libelizainference`) over ONE FFI pipe — no sidecar,
subprocess, or TCP server. The elizaOS llama.cpp fork is the primary backend
compiled into that library, but the contract is "one managed library, one
pipe", not "llama.cpp only". In-process compiled-in backends that link into
`libelizainference` behind the same FFI symbols are **compliant** — e.g.
LiteRT-LM for the Android NPU path, or MLX / CoreML for Apple — because they
are the owned backend, not a separate process. Out-of-process OS model
services (AICore / Gemini Nano, Apple Foundation Models) remain
**opportunistic adapters only**, never the owned backend, and never satisfy
this contract on their own. ONNX (`onnxruntime-node` / `onnxruntime-web`) is
deprecated and will be removed from the runtime path once all native ports land.

### Completed (fork path active — no ONNX in resolved runtime)

| Model | Path | Status |
|---|---|---|
| OmniVoice TTS | fork FFI `libelizainference` (`tools/omnivoice/`) | DONE (W3-3) |
| Silero VAD | standalone `silero-vad-cpp` FFI `libsilero_vad` + `vad/silero-vad-v5.gguf` | DONE (I1/K7 verified) — vad.ts imports zero onnxruntime-node |
| hey-eliza wakeword | fork FFI `eliza_inference_wakeword_*` | DONE (I1/K7 verified) — wake-word.ts imports zero onnxruntime-node |
| ASR (eligible local ASR) | fork FFI `eliza_pick_asr_files()` | DONE (runtime) / GATED (Gemma artifacts) |
| MTP speculative decoding | fork `llama-server` `--spec-type mtp` | DONE |
| Text EOT (Eliza1EotClassifier) | fork `node-llama-cpp` P(`<|im_end|>`) | DONE (preferred path when text model loaded) |
| Fused EOT scorer | fork FFI `eliza_inference_eot_*` + `CompositeEotClassifier` | DONE (J1.d) — preferred runtime path; staged GGUF assets remain bundle-only compatibility |
| Kokoro TTS | fused FFI `eliza_inference_kokoro_*` + `tts/kokoro/kokoro-82m-v1_0-Q4_K_M.gguf` | DONE (#9588) — GGUF-only runtime discovery |
| Wav2Small emotion | ONNX removed; scalar C forward in `voice-classifier-cpp/src/voice_emotion.c` | ONNX-FREE — but native read NOT wired: acoustic emotion path is DEAD at runtime (K1, see gap below) |
| WeSpeaker R34-LM | ONNX removed; scalar C forward in `voice-classifier-cpp/src/voice_speaker.c` | ONNX-FREE (native FFI/GGUF path) |
| pyannote-3 diarizer | ONNX removed; scalar C forward in `voice-classifier-cpp/src/voice_diarizer.c` | ONNX-FREE (native FFI/GGUF path) |

### Compute-gated (native read not yet wired)

| Model | Gate | Owner | Est. |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wav2Small emotion (acoustic read) | ONNX gone; the native GGUF forward is NOT bound into `libelizainference`, and no runtime code loads a `files.emotion` GGUF, so the acoustic read is dead — the fusion in `emotion-attribution.ts` runs text/prosody-only. Tracked, not silently swallowed. | K1 | bind `voice_emotion.c` GGUF forward + parity + pipeline promotion |
| LiveKit EOT (ONNX last-resort) | Historically ONNX was the last-resort in the engine.ts chain (Eliza1Eot → GgmlTD → OnnxTD → Heuristic). With `onnxruntime-*` no longer a dependency, the OnnxTD leg is unreachable; the chain is Eliza1Eot → GgmlTD → Heuristic. | K7/J1.d | confirm OnnxTD leg is removed from the chain |

**Rule:** `onnxruntime-node`/`onnxruntime-web` are no longer dependencies of
`plugin-local-inference` and there must be no live import of either
(`src/services/voice/onnx-import-ban.test.ts` enforces this). Do NOT reintroduce
an ONNX runtime import — the compliant path for any remaining head is the native
FFI/GGUF forward. For a per-model native promotion, update the manifest runtime
to the GGUF runtime, rename the promoted artifact to the canonical manifest
path, and run the relevant gate from `native/verify/PLATFORM_MATRIX.md`.

**GAP (emotion acoustic read — flagged 2026-07-03, C15):** the ONNX Wav2Small
runtime was deleted before the native GGUF read was wired. In production nothing
loads a `files.emotion` GGUF and nothing constructs a
`VoiceEmotionClassifierOutput`, so `attributeVoiceEmotion()` runs
text/prosody-only and the acoustic-fusion branch is dead code. This is flagged
as a tracked follow-up (not silently swallowed): wiring the `voice_emotion.c`
GGUF forward through the memory arbiter — plus a runtime activation gate for a
shipped-but-unrunnable `files.emotion` artifact — is the K1 work (out of
headless scope: needs the native binding + a parity gate). Until then, no
production bundle ships a `files.emotion` artifact.

**HF deprecation runway:** ONNX model files remain on HF alongside GGUFs for one
release after each native port lands. Do not delete ONNX from HF until the GGUF
path has been in production for one release cycle.
