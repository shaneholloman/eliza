/**
 * Pre-ready boot entrypoint for plugin-local-inference.
 *
 * The app-core host used to hard-wire this plugin's boot internals at fixed
 * init points in `repairRuntimeAfterBoot` — importing
 * `@elizaos/plugin-local-inference/runtime` by name and calling
 * `warnIfMobileGateActiveWithoutPlatform` + `shouldEnableMobileLocalInference` +
 * `ensureLocalInferenceHandler` inline (arch-audit #12089 item 18). This single
 * exported hook lets the plugin OWN that boot coupling: it is declared as the
 * app's `bootHook` in `registry-entry.json`, and the host drains it through the
 * generic pre-ready boot-hook channel (naming no plugin).
 *
 * It encapsulates exactly what the host inlined, in the same order and with the
 * same platform gating:
 *   1. Emit the mobile-voice-invariant warning when the mobile local-inference
 *      gate is active but `ELIZA_PLATFORM` is unset (evaluated regardless of
 *      platform, as the host did outside the mobile branch).
 *   2. On a mobile platform, install the local model handler ONLY when the
 *      mobile local-inference gate says a mobile-safe backend is wired.
 *   3. On desktop / server, install the local model handler unconditionally
 *      (`ensureLocalInferenceHandler` self-skips when the runtime mode is cloud
 *      or no backend is available).
 *
 * The host keeps its own `isMobilePlatform()` control flow for the host-only
 * boot steps it skips on mobile (telegram polling, app-route plugins, etc.);
 * this hook only owns the local-inference-specific init.
