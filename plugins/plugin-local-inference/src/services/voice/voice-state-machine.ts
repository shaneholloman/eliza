 * Key transitions (all wired to a `CheckpointManagerLike`):
 *
 *   - `speech-pause` (LISTENING → PAUSE_TENTATIVE)
 *       Save checkpoint named "pre-draft" (C1). Kick the drafter on the
 *       current partial transcript via the caller-supplied `startDrafter`.
 *
 *   - `speech-active` within 2× hangover (PAUSE_TENTATIVE → LISTENING)
 *       Discard C1. Abort the speculative drafter. No rollback is required
 *       because the drafter's KV writes were speculative against a snapshot
 *       we never committed.
 *
 *   - `speech-end` (PAUSE_TENTATIVE → SPEAKING)
 *       Commit the ASR final. The drafter's output is promoted: callers
 *       wire the verifier on top via `onCommit`. **Retain** C1 — a barge-in
 *       while the agent is speaking must roll the KV cache back to the
 *       pre-draft point so the next user turn doesn't see the agent's own
 *       half-spoken response in the prompt.
 *
 *   - `barge-in` (SPEAKING → LISTENING)
 *       Restore C1. Hand the new user speech to the next LISTENING turn.
 *       The same C1 may be restored multiple times — useful when two
 *       consecutive barge-ins land before the next checkpoint is taken
 *       (the test suite covers this).
 *
 * No fallback sludge: a checkpoint failure surfaces via `onError`. The
 * state machine never silently downgrades to a non-checkpointed path —
 * callers turn the feature off via the constructor option.

	 * it returns false the prefill is suppressed and `handleSpeechEnd`
	 * runs a regular (non-prefilled) verifier pass.
