/**
 * A2 — LocalAgreement-n streaming-ASR partial stabilizer.
 *
 * Streaming ASR (the fused Gemma ASR build running on partial windows)
 * emits a fresh partial transcript on every
 * audio frame. Each partial can revise tokens the previous partial
 * already showed — "the cat sa" → "the cat sat" → "the cat sat on" is
 * fine, but "the cat sa" → "the cap sat" rewrites earlier text. Handing
 * a TTS chunker every revision causes audible stutter when the agent's
 * drafter starts speaking text the verifier later rejects.
 *
 * The LocalAgreement-n trick: only commit a prefix to downstream once it
 * has appeared identically in `n` consecutive partials. Below that
 * threshold the text is "pending" — visible to UI for confirmation
 * latency, but never sent to the drafter / phrase chunker. n=2 is the
 * sweet spot for voice — large enough to suppress single-frame ASR
 * jitter, small enough that the stable prefix tracks the speaker
 * within ~one extra frame.
 *
 * Consumer split (#12254): this character-prefix variant serves UI caption
 * rendering, where sub-word agreement ("sa" → "sat") keeps captions
 * responsive and `pending` gives visual feedback. The drafter / barge-in
 * word-confirm consumers use the word-level `LocalAgreementBuffer` /
 * `WordAgreementGate` in `streaming-asr/streaming-pipeline-adapter.ts`,
 * applied automatically by the engine bridge in streaming mode.
 *
 * No `any`, no fallbacks: a malformed partial (e.g. an empty string)
 * collapses the stable prefix to whatever the agreement window still
 * supports — this is correctness, not a swallow.
