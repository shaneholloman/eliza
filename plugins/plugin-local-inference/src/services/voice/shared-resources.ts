/**
 * Cross-cut resource sharing between the text + voice surfaces of a
 * single Eliza-1 bundle.
 *
 * Per `packages/inference/AGENTS.md` §4 ("shared KV cache scheduling,
 * not shared KV memory" + "one process, one llama.cpp build, one GGML
 * pin"), text and voice MUST share:
 *   - the tokenizer (Eliza-1/OmniVoice share a vocabulary in this lineage),
 *   - the mmap regions for weights (deduplicated by absolute path),
 *   - the kernel set (same shipped llama.cpp library after fusion),
 *   - the scheduler queue (one queue, prioritised),
 *   - the native MTP draft path (always wired for Eliza-1).
 *
 * What they do NOT share:
 *   - KV cache memory (different layer counts, different head configs,
 *     different quantizations — separate caches, shared scheduler).
 *
 * This module owns reference counts on each shared resource and is the
 * single arbiter of when a voice-only region can be released. It does
 * NOT do any I/O itself — the actual mmap, madvise, or full model-unload
 * behavior lives behind the `MmapRegionHandle` interface so platform
 * bindings can choose the right memory policy.
