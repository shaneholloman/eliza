/**
 * Built-in Voice Workbench scenarios + a ground-truth mock services adapter

 * The scenario set spans every {@link VoiceScenarioClass} so the headless runner
 * and the headful spec matrix exercise the whole surface from one source. The
 * mock adapter echoes each turn's ground truth, so the CI plumbing lane runs the
 * runner → scorers → report end-to-end and PASSES without any model — separate
