/**
 * Wallet route plugin — registers wallet HTTP route handlers with the
 * elizaOS runtime plugin route system.
 *
 * All routes use `rawPath: true` to preserve the legacy `/api/wallet/*`
 * paths without a plugin-name prefix. This module is node-only — the main
 * runtime plugin (services, actions, providers) lives in `../plugin.ts`
 * and is browser-safe; this `plugin.ts` is loaded only on the server via
 * `../register-routes.ts`.
 *
 * Migrated from packages/app-core/src/api/wallet-market-overview-route.ts.
