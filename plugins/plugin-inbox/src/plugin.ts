/**
 * `inboxPlugin` definition — wires the cross-channel inbox surface into a

 * top-level actions so they resolve wherever the plugin loads), the
 * INBOX_TRIAGE and CROSS_CHANNEL_CONTEXT providers, the triage HTTP routes, the
 * `app_inbox` drizzle schema, and the InboxMigrationService that copies rows
 * across from PA's `app_lifeops` on first boot. Depends on `@elizaos/plugin-sql`
 * for the runtime DB handle the schema registers against.
