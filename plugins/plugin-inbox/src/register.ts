/**
 * Side-effect entry point — registers the inbox view for terminal rendering.
 *
 * In a terminal host (the Node agent, no DOM), register the inbox view so it
 * renders inline in the terminal. Lazy + DOM-guarded so the terminal engine
 * stays out of browser/mobile bundles. Web, iOS, desktop, and Android leave the
 * import inert, so the same import is safe everywhere.
