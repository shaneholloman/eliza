/**
 * elizaOS runtime plugin for the Phone app: exposes a read-only phoneCallLog
 * provider for recent-calls context. Outbound calls are owned by the canonical
 * VOICE_CALL action; the Android dialer implementation remains internal until
 * it is wired as a VOICE_CALL provider. The agent
 * Android adapter applies hosted-app session gating when this package's
 * `/plugin` export is registered.
 *
 * Also declares the Phone Companion (Capacitor pairing/chat-mirror surface)
 * via `app.navTabs`, so the app shell can resolve and mount it dynamically
 * when the companion bundle runs alongside the desktop UI.
