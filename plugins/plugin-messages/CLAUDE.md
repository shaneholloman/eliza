# @elizaos/plugin-messages

Android SMS overlay plugin for elizaOS — provides an SMS inbox and compose surface backed by the native `@elizaos/capacitor-messages` bridge.

## Purpose / role

Adds a Messages GUI view to elizaOS on Android. It lets an Eliza agent and the user read SMS threads and send text messages through the native Android SMS bridge. The plugin is opt-in; load it by including `@elizaos/plugin-messages` in the agent's plugin list. It is marked `androidOnly: true` in its elizaOS app metadata; there is no side-effect app-register module.

## Plugin surface

This plugin registers **views only** — no actions, providers, evaluators, services, or routes:

| View ID | Label | View type | Component export | Path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `messages` | Messages | `gui` | `MessagesView` | `/messages` |

The view bundle path points to `dist/views/bundle.js` (built by `build:views`).

## Layout

```
src/
  plugin.ts              Plugin object — defines the three views registered with @elizaos/core
  index.ts               Public package entry — re-exports plugin and ui
  ui.ts                  Re-exports MessagesView for renderer consumers
  components/
    MessagesView.tsx     GUI data wrapper and Android bridge owner
    messages-view-helpers.ts  Shared helper functions for MessagesView
    messages-interact.ts  interact() capability handler for the view bundle
    MessagesSpatialView.tsx  Spatial SMS surface retained for future modality adapters
    messages-view-bundle.ts  View bundle entry — re-exports interact and view components for Vite bundle
    MessagesView.test.tsx             GUI-level tests for MessagesView
    messages-view-helpers.test.ts     Tests for helpers
    messages-bridge-contract.test.ts  Contract tests for the Capacitor bridge
```

### Key exports

- `appMessagesPlugin` / `default` — the `Plugin` object; import this to register the plugin.
- `MessagesView` — GUI React component used by the plugin view declaration.
- `interact(capability, params?)` — programmatic view API for agents; see capabilities below. Defined in `src/components/messages-interact.ts`; re-exported via `src/components/messages-view-bundle.ts`. Not re-exported from the package root.

### `interact()` capabilities

| Capability | Params | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `list-threads` | `{ limit?: number }` | Thread list + `ownsSmsRole`, `smsRoleHolder` |
| `send-sms` | `{ address: string, body: string }` | `{ sent, address, bodyLength }` |
| `request-sms-role` | — | `{ requested, ownsSmsRole, smsRoleHolder }` |

## Commands

Scripts that exist in this package's `package.json`:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages build          # tsup JS + vite view bundle + type declarations
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages build:js       # tsup library build only
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages build:views    # vite bundle for dist/views/bundle.js
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages build:types    # tsc declarations
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages clean          # rm -rf dist
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages typecheck      # tsgo --noEmit
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages lint           # biome check src
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages test           # vitest run
```

## Config / env vars

This plugin reads **no environment variables** directly. All SMS and system-role operations go through the Capacitor plugin bridge:

- `@elizaos/capacitor-messages` — `Messages.listMessages({ limit })`, `Messages.sendSms({ address, body })`
- `@elizaos/capacitor-system` — `System.getStatus()`, `System.requestRole({ role: "sms" })`

The Android **default SMS role** (`android.app.role.SMS`) must be granted to the elizaOS app for full read/send capability. The UI surfaces a "Set default SMS" prompt when the role is not held.

## How to extend

**Add a new view:**
1. Define the React component in `src/components/`.
2. Export it from a view component module and re-export it from `src/ui.ts`.
3. Add a view entry to the `views` array in `src/plugin.ts` with the correct `bundlePath`, `componentExport`, and modality metadata.
4. If the component needs to be in the view bundle, ensure it is reachable from `src/components/messages-view-bundle.ts` (the Vite entry; see `vite.config.views.ts`).

**Add a new interact capability:**
1. Extend the `interact()` function in `src/components/messages-interact.ts` with a new `if (capability === "...")` branch.
2. Add a corresponding test case for the interact handler.

**Register the plugin in an agent:**
```ts
import messagesPlugin from "@elizaos/plugin-messages";
// pass in the plugins array when constructing the AgentRuntime
```

## Conventions / gotchas

- **Android-only.** Package metadata marks the view app as `androidOnly: true`, and the plugin view declaration sets `nativeOs: true`. Do not add `elizaos.appRegister` unless a real renderer side-effect module exists.
- **View bundle is separate from the library bundle.** `build:js` (tsup) produces `dist/index.js` for the npm package. `build:views` (vite) produces `dist/views/bundle.js` which is loaded at runtime by the plugin view system. Both must be built for a full build.
- **Capacitor bridge in tests.** `vitest.config.ts` aliases `@elizaos/capacitor-messages` → `plugins/plugin-native-messages/src/index.ts` and `@elizaos/capacitor-system` → `plugins/plugin-native-system/src/index.ts`. Tests mock both via `vi.mock`.
- **SMS role vs bridge mode.** The UI shows two modes: "Default SMS app" (owns the role, full inbox) and "Android SMS bridge" (read-only via the capacitor bridge, no role held). Agents can request the role via the interact handler.
- **Interact state.** Agent-driven tests should use the explicit interact handler
  and view snapshot seams instead of parsing renderer-specific DOM.
- **Cross-view recipient handoff.** `MessagesView` consumes a one-shot `{ recipient }` payload via `consumeNavigateViewPayload("messages")` from `@elizaos/ui/app-navigate-view` on mount, opening the composer with the "To" field pre-seeded. Callers dispatch `eliza:navigate:view` with `{ viewId: "messages", viewPath: "/messages", payload: { recipient } }`; the shared UI module must stay generic and contain no Messages-specific pending state.
- **Spatial view.** `MessagesSpatialView` is a presentational component retained for future modality adapters. It is purely presentational (a snapshot + action callback in, spatial primitives out) and does not import Capacitor runtime code.

## ⛔ NON-NEGOTIABLE — evidence, trajectories & real end-to-end tests

> The binding, repo-wide standard is **[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)**. Read it.
> Nothing in this package is *done* until it is *proven* done — a reviewer must confirm it
> works **without reading the code**, from the artifacts you attach. This applies to **every**
> feature, fix, refactor, and chore here. "Tests pass" is not proof; "CI is green" is not proof.

- **Record AND read model trajectories.** Capture the *actual* inputs and outputs of the model
  from a **live** LLM — not the deterministic proxy, not a mock: the prompt, the
  providers/context, the raw model output, every tool/action call, and the result. Then **open
  the trajectory and review it by hand.** A captured-but-unread trajectory is not evidence
  (`packages/scenario-runner/bin/eliza-scenarios run <scenario> --report <out>`).
- **Real, full-featured E2E — no larp.** Every feature ships detailed end-to-end tests that
  drive the *real* path end to end. Not the happy "front door" only: cover error paths,
  edge/empty/invalid input, concurrency, roles/permissions, and adversarial input. A test that
  asserts against a mock/stub/fixture standing in for the thing under test **does not count**.
  If the real model/device/chain/connector/account is hard to reach, **make it reachable — that
  is the work**, not an excuse to mock. If the existing tests here are shallow or mocked, fixing
  them is part of your change.
- **Screenshots + logs at every phase**, plus a **complete walkthrough video/run-through** of
  the entire feature or view, start to finish (`bun run test:e2e:record`).
- **Manually review every artifact the change touches** — never just the green check: client
  logs (console + network), server logs (`[ClassName] …`), the model trajectories in and out,
  before/after full-page screenshots, **and the domain artifacts listed below for this package.**
- **No residuals. No shortcuts.** The goal is not "done" — it is *everything* done. Clear every
  blocker by the **hard path**: build the real architecture, stand up the real
  model/device/service, actually test it. Never leave a TODO, a stub, a stepping-stone, or a
  "follow-up." When unsure, research thoroughly, weigh the options, and ship the best,
  highest-effort, production-ready version. Keep going until every possibility is exhausted.

Artifacts → attached inline in the PR (MP4 video, JPG screenshots, logs in `<details>`); attach each evidence type **or**
explicitly mark it N/A with a reason — never leave it blank. If `develop` moved and changed
behavior, **re-capture** evidence; stale proof is worse than none.

**Capture & manually review for this package — platform connector:**
- A real (or sandbox-account) round-trip on the platform: inbound message → agent → outbound reply, captured as logs **and** a screenshot/recording of the actual conversation.
- The raw inbound event/webhook payload and the outbound API request/response, with IDs mapped correctly (`stringToUuid` / `createUniqueUuid`).
- Attachments, threads/replies, edits, multi-account, and rate-limit/error paths — not just a single text ping.
- The agent trajectory for the turn the connector drove.
