/**
 * Runner-side dispatch fallback policy.
 *
 * Pure function. The runner calls {@link decideDispatchPolicy} with each
 * `DispatchResult` from a connector or channel `send` and applies the returned
 * decision against the active `ScheduledTask` escalation ladder
 * (see `applyDispatchPolicy` in `scheduled-task/runner.ts`).
 *
 * Decision matrix:
 * - `ok: true`                           → `complete`
 * - `userActionable: true` failure       → `surface_degraded` (advance ladder)
 *                                          and surface via the
 *                                          connector-degradation provider.
 * - `retryAfterMinutes` set              → `retry` (do NOT advance ladder).
 * - other failure                        → `advance` (mark current step failed,
 *                                          advance to next step).
 * - last step failed                     → `fail` (state.status = "failed",
 *                                          pipeline.onFail fires).

/**
 * Decision the runner should apply after a single dispatch attempt.
 *
 * - `complete` — dispatch succeeded; the step is done. The runner records
 *   `messageId` on the task state log if present.
 * - `retry` — reschedule the same step after `retryAfterMinutes`. The ladder
 *   index is NOT advanced. Surface as `retrying` in the state log.
 * - `advance` — the current step is permanently failed. Advance the ladder to
 *   the next step. If no further step exists the runner emits `fail`.
 * - `surface_degraded` — same as `advance`, plus the failure should be
 *   surfaced through the connector-degradation provider (which gates
 *   visibility in subsequent providers; the runner consumes the flag).
 * - `fail` — terminal: every step has failed (or the only step failed without
 *   a retry hint). Runner sets `state.status = "failed"` and fires
 *   `pipeline.onFail`.
