 * Side-effect entry point — registers the calendar view for terminal rendering.
 *
 * In a terminal host (the Node agent, no DOM), register the calendar view so it
 * renders inline in the terminal. Lazy + DOM-guarded so the terminal engine
 * stays out of browser/mobile bundles; on a DOM host this module is inert.
