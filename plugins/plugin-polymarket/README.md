# @elizaos/plugin-polymarket

Native Polymarket app plugin for elizaOS — market discovery, orderbook quote reads, position reads, and trading readiness context.

## What it does

Adds Polymarket prediction-market capabilities to an Eliza agent:

- **Market discovery** — lists active markets from the Polymarket Gamma API with bid/ask prices and 24-hour volume.
- **Single market detail** — fetches a market by Gamma ID or slug, including all outcome prices and CLOB token IDs.
- **Orderbook quotes** — reads full CLOB bid/ask depth for a token ID and derives best bid, best ask, midpoint, and spread.
- **Wallet positions** — returns open positions for a given wallet address from the Polymarket Data API.
- **Trading readiness** — reports which credentials are configured and why signed order placement is currently disabled.
- **UI view** — GUI view registered in the elizaOS view registry.

## Enabling the plugin

Add the package to the agent's plugin list:

```ts
import { polymarketPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-polymarket";

const agent = {
  plugins: [polymarketPlugin],
  // ...
};
```

No credentials are required for public reads. Trading configuration is optional (see below).

## Agent action: `PREDICTION_MARKET`

The plugin registers one agent action. Pass `action` (or `subaction`) and `kind` parameters:

| `action` | `kind` | Required params | Description |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| `read` | `status` | — | Readiness and credential report |
| `read` | `markets` | — | Active market list (`limit` 1–100, `offset`) |
| `read` | `market` | `id` or `slug` | Single market detail |
| `read` | `orderbook` | `tokenId` (CLOB token id) | Full orderbook with best bid/ask |
| `read` | `positions` | `user` (wallet address) | Open positions for a wallet |
| `place_order` | — | — | Reports readiness; does not place trades |

Legacy action names (`POLYMARKET_READ`, `POLYMARKET_STATUS`, `POLYMARKET_GET_MARKETS`, `POLYMARKET_GET_ORDERBOOK`, `POLYMARKET_PLACE_ORDER`, etc.) are accepted as similes.

## API routes

The plugin registers these HTTP routes on the agent's API server:

| Method | Path | Query params |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/polymarket/status` | — |
| GET | `/api/polymarket/markets` | `limit`, `offset`, `active`, `closed`, `order`, `ascending`, `tag_id` |
| GET | `/api/polymarket/market` | `id` or `slug` |
| GET | `/api/polymarket/orderbook` | `token_id` |
| GET | `/api/polymarket/positions` | `user` |
| GET / POST | `/api/polymarket/orders` | Returns 501 (disabled) |

## Environment variables

Public reads (markets, orderbook, positions) require no credentials.

Signed CLOB trading is disabled in this app integration. When credentials are present the status endpoint reports readiness; the `place_order` action still returns a readiness report only.

| Variable | Alias | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` | — | Wallet private key for signed orders |
| `CLOB_API_KEY` | `POLYMARKET_CLOB_API_KEY` | CLOB API key |
| `CLOB_API_SECRET` | `POLYMARKET_CLOB_SECRET` | CLOB API secret |
| `CLOB_API_PASSPHRASE` | `POLYMARKET_CLOB_PASSPHRASE` | CLOB API passphrase |

## Orderbook semantics

The `/api/polymarket/orderbook` route reads the full CLOB orderbook for a token id and derives best bid, best ask, midpoint, and spread from all returned levels (it does not assume the upstream CLOB response is sorted). Use the CLOB `token_id`, not the Gamma `conditionId` — a market has one condition id but one or more CLOB token ids (one per outcome).

## Building

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-polymarket build
```

This runs tsup (runtime bundle), Vite (GUI view bundle), and tsc (type declarations).
