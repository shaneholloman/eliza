/**
 * Shared string constants and response/DTO types for the Hyperliquid plugin:
 * guidance/error copy for credential and execution states, and the typed
 * shapes of every `/api/hyperliquid/*` route response (status, markets,
 * funding, positions, orders). Consumed by `routes.ts`, `client.ts`, the
 * `PERPETUAL_MARKET` action, and the React/GUI views — this is the single
 * source of truth for those shapes so route, client, and UI stay in sync.
