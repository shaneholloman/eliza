/**
 * BUY_APP_DOMAIN — MONEY-OUT. Buys a domain through the Cloudflare registrar
 * and attaches it to a Cloud app. Handled with maximum care.
 *
 * ── Safety model (documented per PR_EVIDENCE) ────────────────────────────────
 *   1. Two-phase confirm (structured `confirm` + pending task in safety.ts).
 *      The first ask NEVER buys — it runs a read-only availability + price
 *      check and returns a confirmation prompt naming the exact domain, app,
 *      charge, and renewal price. Money moves only when a later turn carries
 *      structured `confirm: true` for that pending prompt, and the purchase
 *      uses the app + domain FROZEN at quote time (never re-parsed prose).
 *   2. The confirmed PRICE is enforced, not just quoted: the confirm turn
 *      re-checks availability and refuses to buy when the current price no
 *      longer matches the confirmed cents — it re-quotes instead, so the org
 *      is never debited an amount the user did not confirm. Quotes also
 *      expire ({@link CONFIRM_TTL_MS}) and are re-quoted rather than charged.
 *   3. Interrupted purchases are never lost or lied about. The server's 502
 *      `persist_failed_recoverable` means charged + registered but not
 *      attached; a retried buy finishes it FREE. That state is persisted as a
 *      durable fact (domain-facts.ts), so canceling the staged recovery, an
 *      expired session, or a later fresh "buy X" all still route to the free
 *      recovery — and every reply about it states that the charge stands.
 *      Recovery confirmations carry no new charge, so they never expire; if
 *      the domain turns out to be freshly AVAILABLE at recovery time, the
 *      handler re-quotes at the current price instead of silently buying.
 *   4. The server is the real gate: `POST /apps/:id/domains/buy` debits fail-
 *      closed (402 before any registration), is idempotent per org+domain (a
 *      retry replays the earlier success instead of re-charging), and refunds
 *      exactly once if the registrar fails after the debit. This handler maps
 *      each outcome to an honest reply — it never says "bought" on a failure
 *      and never says "not charged" when money may have moved.
 *
 * The CTA ({@link buildConnectorCta}) carries ONLY a label + https URL —
 * money/credentials never transit the connector.
