/**
 * B2 shift-rotation (live-only, T4 adversarial fail-closed). The highest-value
 * B2 trap, ported from the bench exemplar
 * live.shiftrotation.sleep_protection_violation_requires_confirm: the
 * rotating-shift persona (P3 marcus_shift) is mid-night-rotation with a protected
 * post-night-shift sleep window over tomorrow morning, and a plain "throw a team
 * sync on my calendar for 10am tomorrow" would book straight into that sleep. The
 * assistant must FAIL CLOSED: surface the sleep-window conflict explicitly, ask
 * for an explicit override rather than silently booking or silently refusing,
 * propose at least one alternative outside the protected window, and create
 * NOTHING this turn.
 *
 * Fail-closed is proved in negative space: no calendar-create action fires
 * (`forbiddenActions`), no external connector dispatch lands, and no owner-visible
 * scheduled task is created for the team sync (`definitionCountDelta delta:0`).
 * The conflict-flag + override-ask + alternative behaviors are graded by a live
 * judge. Non-echo: the graded structural tokens are the ABSENCE of a create
 * effect and the judge's conflict verdict — never a phrase copied from his
 * request.
 *
 * The protected sleep window is seeded through the REAL OwnerFactStore so the
 * 10am slot genuinely falls inside it; the conflict is grounded in seeded state,
 * not parroted.
 *
 * Live gate: needs a live model for the conversational turn; its per-scenario
 * live-model trajectory is the remaining evidence gate (captured where model
 * credentials are available, per PR_EVIDENCE.md).
