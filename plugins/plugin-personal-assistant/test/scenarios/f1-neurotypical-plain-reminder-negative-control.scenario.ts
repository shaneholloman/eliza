/**
 * F1 neurotypical-control-adversarial (live). NEGATIVE CONTROL: the plainest
 * possible "remind me to X at time Y" flow from a neutral owner. The assistant
 * must create the reminder at the literal requested time and keep the reply a
 * bare confirmation — no re-timing to a "friendlier" hour, no biological-night
 * reflag, no decomposition, no coaching. The floor the persona packs must never
 * regress below (#12283).
 *
 * Personas-as-data: the framing lives in the turn text, never in
 * `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one scheduler, structural fields only).
