/**
 * B1 night-owl-anchored-day (live). noor_night first states her sleep window,
 * then contradicts it a beat later ("actually I've been sleeping earlier this
 * week, don't assume 11:30 anymore"). The assistant must UPDATE the single
 * quiet-hours/anchor rule in place, not layer a second conflicting rule on top.
 * Exercises contradiction reconciliation on the personas pack (#12283); maps to
 * LifeOpsBench live.nightowl.contradiction_reconciles_anchor.
 *
 * Personas-as-data: the correction lives in the turn text, never in
 * `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one scheduler, structural fields only).
 *
 * OUTCOME (not echo): definitionCountDelta{delta:1} on the quiet-hours rule
 * proves the correction converged to ONE rule (an update, not a second layered
 * definition), and the judge grades that the old 11:30 assumption was replaced
 * rather than duplicated. Asserted concepts are derived from the response.
 *
 * Live-verify note (#12781): whether the update mutates the existing definition
 * or replaces it is confirmed at live capture; the load-bearing outcome (exactly
 * one surviving quiet-hours rule, not two conflicting ones) does not depend on it.
