/**
 * B1 night-owl-anchored-day (live, T4 rejection trap). The assistant proposes a
 * wall-clock 9am reminder by mistake; noor_night rejects it ("no. after i'm up.
 * fix it.") and the assistant must repair the definition to anchor-relative
 * (after-wake) semantics, keeping NO 9am due time. Exercises correction-honoring
 * on the personas pack (#12283); maps to LifeOpsBench
 * live.nightowl.reject_wall_clock_repair.
 *
 * Personas-as-data: the correction lives in the turn text, never in
 * `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one scheduler, structural fields only).
 *
 * OUTCOME (not echo): definitionCountDelta with forbiddenDueLocalTimes 09:00
 * proves the final build-check reminder carries NO 9am due time (the correction
 * actually landed in state), and the judge grades that the repair is
 * anchor-relative and non-defensive. Asserted concepts are derived from the
 * response, not copied from the user turn.
 *
 * Live-verify note (#12781): the exact repaired-anchor encoding is confirmed at
 * live capture; the load-bearing outcome (no surviving 9am due time) does not
 * depend on it.
