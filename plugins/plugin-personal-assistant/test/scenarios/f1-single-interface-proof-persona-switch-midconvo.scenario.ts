/**
 * F1 neurotypical-control-adversarial (live). CONTROL: one conversation that
 * starts businesslike and then, mid-thread, the owner discloses they are having
 * an ADHD-overwhelm day. There is ONE interface, not two modes: the assistant
 * must simply meet the owner where they are on the later turn (a little more
 * support once overwhelm is actually signalled) WITHOUT retroactively rewriting
 * the earlier crisp exchange or announcing a "mode switch". Proves the persona
 * adaptation is a graceful, continuous response to signals — not a branch on a
 * hidden persona flag (#12283).
 *
 * Personas-as-data: both the businesslike ask and the later disclosure live in
 * the turn text, never in `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one scheduler,
 * structural fields only).
