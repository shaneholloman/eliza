/**
 * A2 adhd-follow-through (live). casey_adhd missed a reminder yesterday and asks
 * for the next move without "a whole thing" being made of it. The assistant must
 * repair without shame or streak language: acknowledge the miss neutrally, offer
 * ONE smaller next step instead of restarting the full task, and ask before
 * scheduling anything. Non-shaming follow-through repair on the personas pack
 * (#12283). Ports LifeOpsBench live.adhd.follow.missed_step_replan_without_guilt.
 *
 * Personas-as-data: the messy, apologetic voice lives in the turn text, never in
 * `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one scheduler, structural fields only).
 *
 * Live-only: the judge grades tone (no blame/discipline framing) plus the
 * shrink-and-consent mechanics, which the deterministic proxy cannot exercise —
 * it always emits a reply, so a tone/consent judgment needs a real model.
 * Live-verify deferred to the key boundary (#12781).

Deduct heavily for guilt/streak language, for restarting the full task, or for creating/claiming a reminder without asking.",
