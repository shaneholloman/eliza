/**
 * B1 night-owl-anchored-day (live). noor_night wants a nudge "by my evening" if
 * she hasn't stretched — and her evening is her own pre-sleep window, not
 * calendar midnight. The assistant must anchor the nudge to her sleep/evening
 * boundary rather than a default clock hour, and keep it flexible. Exercises
 * owner-relative day-boundary reasoning on the personas pack (#12283); maps to
 * LifeOpsBench live.nightowl.end_of_her_evening_nudge.
 *
 * Personas-as-data: the day-boundary framing lives in the turn text, never in
 * `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one scheduler, structural fields only).
 *
 * OUTCOME (not echo): definitionCountDelta proves a stretch nudge was actually
 * created AND that it was NOT pinned to a calendar-evening 17:00 or to midnight,
 * and the judge grades that the anchor is her pre-sleep window. Asserted concepts
 * are derived from the response, not copied from the user turn.
 *
 * Live-verify note (#12781): the exact anchor encoding (evening window vs.
 * relative-to-bedtime) is confirmed at live capture; the load-bearing outcome
 * (a flexible nudge, not a fixed 5pm/midnight time) does not depend on it.
