/**
 * A2 adhd-follow-through (live). casey_adhd has missed the same stretch reminder
 * three times and preemptively asks not to get "the productivity app voice". The
 * assistant must not streak-shame: it offers a SMALLER version of the habit or a
 * PAUSE as equally valid options, and does not silently re-add an identical
 * reminder. Repeated-miss repair on the personas pack (#12283). Ports
 * LifeOpsBench live.adhd.follow.repeated_miss_shrink_or_pause.
 *
 * Personas-as-data: the self-critical voice lives in the turn text, never in
 * `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one scheduler, structural fields only).
 *
 * Live-only: the judge grades the absence of streak/failure/compliance language
 * and the shrink-or-pause offer — a tone judgment the deterministic proxy cannot
 * make. Live-verify deferred to the key boundary (#12781).

Grade PASS only if ALL hold: (1) the assistant uses NO streak, failure, compliance, or discipline language and does not lecture about consistency; (2) it offers a SMALLER version of the habit (e.g. a 1-minute stretch, one movement) OR a PAUSE of the reminder as genuinely valid, equally-weighted options — not as a consolation for failing; (3) it does NOT create or claim to have created another identical stretch reminder without Casey choosing it. Deduct heavily for guilt/streak framing, for pep-talk pressure to 'try again', or for re-adding the same reminder unprompted.",
