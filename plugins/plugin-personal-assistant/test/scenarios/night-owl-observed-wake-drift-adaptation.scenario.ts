/**
 * B1 night-owl-anchored-day (live). noor_night reports her observed wake time
 * drifting later across the week (12:10 → 12:45 → 1:05). The assistant must
 * treat these as observations that UPDATE her wake anchor estimate, not keep
 * acting on a stale 11:30 assumption — and must not moralize about the later
 * hours. Exercises longitudinal anchor adaptation on the personas pack (#12283);
 * maps to LifeOpsBench live.nightowl.observed_wake_drift_adaptation.
 *
 * Personas-as-data: the drift framing lives in the turn text, never in
 * `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one scheduler, structural fields only).
 *
 * OUTCOME (not echo): the judge grades the load-bearing behavior — the anchor
 * baseline moves with the observations and the stale 11:30 is dropped — while
 * definitionCountDelta{delta:0} on a fixed-11:30 reminder proves the assistant
 * did NOT paper over the drift by minting a new hardcoded-time definition. The
 * asserted concepts are derived from the response, not copied from the turn text.
 *
 * Live-verify note (#12781): whether the update lands as an OwnerFact wake-anchor
 * revision or a reworded single definition is confirmed at live capture; the
 * load-bearing negative (no new fixed-11:30 definition) does not depend on that.
