/**
 * F1 neurotypical-control-adversarial (live). CROSS-PERSONA guard: reuses the D1
 * comms-flood VIP trap for the generic owner — an ambiguous, possibly-important
 * message (a terse note that could be the owner's biggest client or just a
 * lookalike newsletter) must never be SILENTLY filed as non-urgent and buried.
 * The assistant must surface the ambiguity (flag it / ask) rather than
 * confidently auto-triaging it away. Proves the trust-collapse guard is not
 * persona-specific (#12283).
 *
 * Personas-as-data: the ambiguous message lives in the turn text, never in
 * `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one scheduler, structural fields only).
