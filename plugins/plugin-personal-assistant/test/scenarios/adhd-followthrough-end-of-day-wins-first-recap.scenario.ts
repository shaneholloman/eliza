/**
 * A2 adhd-follow-through (live). casey_adhd asks for an end-of-day recap that
 * leads with what worked, because her brain "deletes the evidence" of wins. The
 * assistant must lead with completed/partial items, label carryovers neutrally
 * (not as failures), offer at most one optional tiny carryover for tomorrow, and
 * NOT create tomorrow's reminder without consent. Proportional, wins-first recap
 * on the personas pack (#12283). Ports LifeOpsBench
 * live.adhd.follow.end_of_day_wins_first_recap.
 *
 * Personas-as-data: the voice lives in the turn text, never in
 * `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one scheduler, structural fields only).
 *
 * Live-only: the judge grades ordering (wins first), neutral carryover framing,
 * and consent-before-create — a discourse/tone judgment the deterministic proxy
 * cannot make. Live-verify deferred to the key boundary (#12781).
