/**
 * D1 comms-flood-triage (live). dre_flood flags a message as important-but-not-
 * urgent and explicitly does NOT want it surfaced now — but it must not vanish
 * either. The assistant must capture a deferred resurfacing record so the item
 * comes back on its own later (e.g. end-of-day), separating the urgency axis from
 * the importance axis. Ports the D1 "important-not-urgent resurfacing" premise
 * (#12281 tier rubric T3 / #12283 D1 table).
 *
 * Personas-as-data: the "important not urgent, resurface later" instruction lives
 * in the turn text, never in `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one
 * scheduler, structural fields only).
 *
 * OUTCOME (not echo/routing): a definitionCountDelta proves exactly one deferred
 * resurfacing record was created (delta:1), and the judge grades the load-bearing
 * nuance — held for later, not surfaced now, not dropped.
