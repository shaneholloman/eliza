 * F1 neurotypical-control-adversarial (live). CONTROL: a neutral owner rattles
 * off two crisp, unambiguous asks with zero signals of overwhelm or
 * neurodivergence. The assistant must stay businesslike — capture what was asked
 * and stop — and NOT proactively offer body-doubling, task decomposition,
 * "one small step", or check-in scaffolding that only fits a signalled ADHD /
 * low-activation profile. Proves the persona accommodations are opt-in, not the
 * default surface (#12283).

 * `promptInstructions` (root AGENTS.md — one scheduler, structural fields only).
