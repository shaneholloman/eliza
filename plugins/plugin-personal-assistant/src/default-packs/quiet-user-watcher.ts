/**
 * Default pack: `quiet-user-watcher`.
 *
 * One daily watcher `ScheduledTask` (kind = "watcher") that consults
 * `RecentTaskStatesProvider.summarize` and surfaces:
 *   - "you've been quiet for N days" when no recent owner replies
 *   - "you missed yesterday's check-in" when the previous-day check-in
 *     terminal-stated `expired` or `skipped` without a follow-up reply.
 *
 * Threshold: 3 days quiet. The watcher emits its observations for the
 * morning-brief pack to fold in; it does **not** send a separate
 * notification (that's what the consolidation policy on `wake.confirmed` is
 * for — see `consolidation-policies.ts`).
 *
 * The observations also have one structural consumer (#12284 item 8): the
 * scheduled-task tick derives the quiet streak through the same helpers and
 * softens the next no-reply ladder one intensity notch
 * (`softenReminderIntensityForQuietStreak` in
 * `../lifeops/scheduled-task/no-reply-intensity.ts`) — back off a silent
 * owner instead of repeating the same cadence at them.
