/** System prompt that classifies a user's reply to a workflow draft as confirm / cancel / modify / new. */
export const DRAFT_INTENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `Determine what the user wants to do with this workflow draft. A draft has been generated and shown to the user as a preview.

Your job: determine what the user wants to do based on their message. The user may write in ANY language — interpret the meaning, not specific keywords.

Possible intents:
- "confirm": The user approves the draft and wants it deployed. This includes any form of agreement, approval, or instruction to proceed/create/deploy the current draft.
- "cancel": The user doesn't want this workflow at all and wants to discard it entirely.
- "modify": The user wants to change something about the current draft, or is providing additional context/answers to refine it.
- "new": The user explicitly describes a DIFFERENT workflow with DIFFERENT services or purpose than the current draft. This requires a concrete description of a new automation.

Rules:
- CRITICAL: A short or vague message that does NOT describe a specific new automation is NEVER "new". Short messages like "create it", "do it", "go ahead", or any brief instruction to proceed are ALWAYS "confirm". Only classify as "new" if the message contains an explicit description of a different workflow involving different integrations or a different purpose.
- If the user's message could refer to the existing draft (even loosely), it is NOT "new".
- If ambiguous between "confirm" and "new", ALWAYS prefer "confirm".
- If ambiguous between "modify" and "new", prefer "modify".
- If the user provides additional context or answers clarification questions about the same topic, treat as "modify".
- For "modify", extract the modification request as a clear instruction.

Respond with structured JSON-style fields:
intent: confirm | cancel | modify | new
modificationRequest: only for modify; concise instruction
reason: brief classification explanation`;
