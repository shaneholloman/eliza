/** System prompt that matches a user request to the best of their existing workflows with a confidence grade. */
export const WORKFLOW_MATCHING_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `Match the user's request to the most appropriate workflow from their available workflows.

Consider:
- Keywords and phrases in the workflow name that match the request
- The semantic meaning and intent of the user's request
- Context clues about what the workflow might do

Rules:
- Only return "high" confidence if the match is obvious and unambiguous
- Return "medium" if there's a likely match but some ambiguity
- Return "low" if there's a weak connection
- Return "none" if no workflow matches the request
- If multiple workflows match equally well, include all in matches array and set lower confidence

Respond with structured JSON-style fields:
matchedWorkflowId: best matching workflow ID, or null if no good match
confidence: high | medium | low | none
matches:
  - id: workflow ID
    name: workflow name
    score: 0-100
reason: brief explanation`;
