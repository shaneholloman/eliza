# @elizaos/plugin-task-coordinator

UI workbench for managing coding-agent task threads and PTY sessions inside elizaOS.

## What it does

This plugin adds two interactive surfaces to the elizaOS dashboard:

**Task Coordinator** — lists active coding-agent sessions and task threads, shows live PTY output from running agents, and lets you stop individual sessions or all sessions at once.

**Orchestrator** — a multi-agent task orchestration workbench. Create task threads with goals and acceptance criteria, assign sub-agents (elizaOS, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi Agent), monitor their timeline of events and messages, fork tasks, validate results, and send messages to running tasks — all from one panel.

Both surfaces ship as dashboard GUI views. The view manifest keeps the standard
view contract so future adapters can be added without changing the component
exports.

The plugin also fills the coding-agent slot components that `@elizaos/ui` leaves empty until a slot provider registers them:
- A header control chip showing active agent count with a stop-all button.
- The per-framework settings section (model, LLM provider, approval preset, GitHub connection).
- The PTY console (drawer, side-panel, and full-screen variants).

## Capabilities

The Orchestrator panel supports these operations:

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Status | Get current orchestrator status |
| List tasks | List task threads, filter by status, search, include archived |
| Open task | Open a task thread detail view |
| Create task | Create a new task with title, goal, priority, acceptance criteria |
| Pause / resume task | Pause or resume a single task |
| Pause all / resume all | Bulk pause or resume |
| Delete task | Remove a task thread |
| Fork task | Fork an existing task with a new title/goal/priority |
| Update task | Edit title, goal, summary, priority, acceptance criteria |
| Validate task | Record a validation pass/fail result with evidence |
| Add agent | Attach a sub-agent (framework, model, workdir, repo) to a task |
| Stop agent | Stop a specific sub-agent session |
| Send message | Send a message to a task thread |

## Requirements

- `@elizaos/core` (workspace dependency)
- `@elizaos/ui` (workspace dependency — provides client API, slot registry, shared types)
- `@elizaos/plugin-agent-orchestrator` must be running to provide task/session state; this plugin is display-only.

## Enabling

Add `@elizaos/plugin-task-coordinator` to your agent's plugin list. No env vars are required.

Per-framework coding-agent settings (model, LLM provider, approval preset) are configured through the Settings panel in the dashboard UI, not via environment variables.

## Supported agent frameworks

The settings panel manages configuration for: elizaOS, Pi Agent, OpenCode, Claude, and Codex.

## Build

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-task-coordinator build
```

This runs tsup (plugin JS) + Vite (view bundle → `dist/views/bundle.js`) + tsc (type declarations).

## Tests

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-task-coordinator test
```

A live end-to-end test (`test:e2e:manual`) requires the `codex` CLI to be installed and authenticated (`~/.codex/auth.json`). It is skipped automatically when those conditions are not met.
