# @elizaos/plugin-elevenlabs

Provides ElevenLabs-powered text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) model handlers for Eliza agents.

## Purpose / role

This plugin registers `ModelType.TEXT_TO_SPEECH` and `ModelType.TRANSCRIPTION` handlers with the elizaOS runtime so any agent that loads it can call `runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_TO_SPEECH, ...)` or `runtime.useModel(ModelType.TRANSCRIPTION, ...)` backed by the ElevenLabs API. It is opt-in: add `@elizaos/plugin-elevenlabs` to the agent's `plugins` list in character config. It has no actions, providers, evaluators, services, or routes — only model handlers.

## Plugin surface

| Kind | Name | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| Model handler | `ModelType.TEXT_TO_SPEECH` | Streams audio from ElevenLabs TTS API, returns `Uint8Array` |
| Model handler | `ModelType.TRANSCRIPTION` | Sends audio to ElevenLabs Scribe STT API, returns transcript string |
| Tests | inline plugin test suite | Validates API key, voice settings, STT config, and (if key present) live connectivity |

No actions, providers, evaluators, services, routes, or events are registered.

## Layout

```
plugins/plugin-elevenlabs/
  src/
    index.ts           Plugin definition, all model handler logic, settings helpers
    index.node.ts      Node entry — re-exports index.ts (used as module/cjs)
    index.browser.ts   Browser entry — re-exports index.ts (used as browser build)
  __tests__/
    streaming.test.ts  Functional tests for TTS streaming path (chunk draining, SDK params, error propagation)
  build.ts             Bun build script
  package.json
```

Everything lives in `src/index.ts`. There are no separate action or service files.

## Commands

Scripts that exist in this package's `package.json`:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs build          # compile dist/
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs dev            # watch build (--hot)
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs test           # run __tests__
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs clean          # rm -rf dist .turbo .turbo-tsconfig.json tsconfig.tsbuildinfo
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs lint           # biome check --write --unsafe
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs lint:check     # biome check (read-only)
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs format         # biome format --write
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs format:check   # biome format (read-only)
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs typecheck      # tsgo --project tsconfig.json --noEmit
```

## Config / env vars

Settings are resolved from `runtime.getSetting(key)` first, then `process.env[key]`. All are read at call time inside the model handler — no service startup required.

| Var | Required | Default | Notes |
|-----|----------|---------|-------|
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | **Yes** | — | ElevenLabs API key |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` | No | `EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL` | Voice ID for TTS |
| `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_ID` | No | `eleven_monolingual_v1` | TTS model ID |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_STABILITY` | No | `0.5` | 0–1 |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_SIMILARITY_BOOST` | No | `0.75` | 0–1 |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_STYLE` | No | `0` | 0–1 |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_USE_SPEAKER_BOOST` | No | `true` | boolean string |
| `ELEVENLABS_OPTIMIZE_STREAMING_LATENCY` | No | `0` | 0–4 |
| `ELEVENLABS_OUTPUT_FORMAT` | No | `mp3_44100_128` | ElevenLabs format enum |
| `ELEVENLABS_BROWSER_URL` | No | — | Proxy base URL for browser builds; skips API key requirement |
| `ELEVENLABS_STT_MODEL_ID` | No | `scribe_v1` | STT model ID |
| `ELEVENLABS_STT_LANGUAGE_CODE` | No | — | Leave unset for auto-detect |
| `ELEVENLABS_STT_TIMESTAMPS_GRANULARITY` | No | `word` | `none` / `word` / `character` |
| `ELEVENLABS_STT_DIARIZE` | No | `false` | boolean string |
| `ELEVENLABS_STT_NUM_SPEAKERS` | No | — | 1–32; only used when diarize=true |
| `ELEVENLABS_STT_TAG_AUDIO_EVENTS` | No | `false` | boolean string |

## How to extend

This plugin has no extensible action registry — it only registers model handlers. To add a new model type handler:

1. Open `src/index.ts`.
2. Add a new key under the `models` object on `elevenLabsPlugin` using a `ModelType.*` constant from `@elizaos/core`.
3. Implement the handler as `async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, input: <InputType>) => <OutputType>`.
4. Document the new env vars in `package.json` under `agentConfig.pluginParameters`.

To add an action, provider, or service (not currently present), add an `actions`, `providers`, or `services` array to the plugin object following the pattern in the root AGENTS.md and elizaOS core docs.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **Browser builds:** `ELEVENLABS_BROWSER_URL` redirects requests to a server-side proxy that injects the API key. In browser mode, configure either `ELEVENLABS_BROWSER_URL` or a real `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`; otherwise model calls fail before contacting the SDK.
- **Output format:** The default output format is `mp3_44100_128` (browser-safe). Avoid `pcm_*` formats in browser contexts; PCM is fine for Node/server deployments. Pass an explicit `format` field in the `useModel` input object to override per-call.
- **TTS input shape:** `runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_TO_SPEECH, ...)` accepts either a plain string or `{ text, model?, voiceId?, format?, instructions? }`.
- **STT input shape:** Accepts a URL string, a `Buffer`, or `{ audioUrl: string; prompt?: string }`.
- **Format validation:** `parseTtsOutputFormat` and `parseSttModelId` throw on unrecognized enum values — use values from the `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js/api` enums.
- **No WAV support:** WAV header utilities were removed; use mp3 or pcm formats directly.
- **SDK dependency:** Uses `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js` ^2.16.0 (official ElevenLabs SDK). All API calls go through `ElevenLabsClient`.

## ⛔ NON-NEGOTIABLE — evidence, trajectories & real end-to-end tests

> The binding, repo-wide standard is **[PR_EVIDENCE.md](../../PR_EVIDENCE.md)**. Read it.
> Nothing in this package is *done* until it is *proven* done — a reviewer must confirm it
> works **without reading the code**, from the artifacts you attach. This applies to **every**
> feature, fix, refactor, and chore here. "Tests pass" is not proof; "CI is green" is not proof.

- **Record AND read model trajectories.** Capture the *actual* inputs and outputs of the model
  from a **live** LLM — not the deterministic proxy, not a mock: the prompt, the
  providers/context, the raw model output, every tool/action call, and the result. Then **open
  the trajectory and review it by hand.** A captured-but-unread trajectory is not evidence
  (`packages/scenario-runner/bin/eliza-scenarios run <scenario> --report <out>`).
- **Real, full-featured E2E — no larp.** Every feature ships detailed end-to-end tests that
  drive the *real* path end to end. Not the happy "front door" only: cover error paths,
  edge/empty/invalid input, concurrency, roles/permissions, and adversarial input. A test that
  asserts against a mock/stub/fixture standing in for the thing under test **does not count**.
  If the real model/device/chain/connector/account is hard to reach, **make it reachable — that
  is the work**, not an excuse to mock. If the existing tests here are shallow or mocked, fixing
  them is part of your change.
- **Screenshots + logs at every phase**, plus a **complete walkthrough video/run-through** of
  the entire feature or view, start to finish (`bun run test:e2e:record`).
- **Manually review every artifact the change touches** — never just the green check: client
  logs (console + network), server logs (`[ClassName] …`), the model trajectories in and out,
  before/after full-page screenshots, **and the domain artifacts listed below for this package.**
- **No residuals. No shortcuts.** The goal is not "done" — it is *everything* done. Clear every
  blocker by the **hard path**: build the real architecture, stand up the real
  model/device/service, actually test it. Never leave a TODO, a stub, a stepping-stone, or a
  "follow-up." When unsure, research thoroughly, weigh the options, and ship the best,
  highest-effort, production-ready version. Keep going until every possibility is exhausted.

Artifacts → attached inline in the PR (MP4 video, JPG screenshots, logs in `<details>`); attach each evidence type **or**
explicitly mark it N/A with a reason — never leave it blank. If `develop` moved and changed
behavior, **re-capture** evidence; stale proof is worse than none.

**Capture & manually review for this package — voice / audio:**
- Captured **audio** of the real round-trip (STT in, TTS out) plus the transcript, with a narrated walkthrough of what is happening.
- Latency, barge-in/interruption, and wake-word behavior measured on real audio — across platforms, not Linux-x64-synthetic only (see #9958).
- The model trajectory for any LLM turn inside the loop.
- Failure paths: no mic, silence, noise, overlapping speech, network drop mid-stream.
