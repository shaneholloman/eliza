/**
 * Side-effect entry point — registers the goals view for terminal rendering.
 *
 * In a terminal host (the Node agent, no DOM) this registers the unified goals
 * view so it renders inline in the terminal. Lazy + DOM-guarded so the terminal
 * engine stays out of browser/mobile bundles. Load this module once during app
 * startup; in a browser/mobile host it is a no-op.
