# Issue #11741 - Audio and SFX Provider Registry Evidence

## What Changed

- Added `packages/cloud/shared/src/lib/providers/audio` with provider registry selection for music and sound effects.
- Moved FAL MiniMax Music request mapping, queue polling, response normalization, and credential checks out of the `/api/v1/generate-music` route.
- Added ElevenLabs sound-effects generation and FAL Stable Audio generation behind the same audio provider contract.
- Added `/api/v1/generate-sfx` with SFX pricing, credit reservation/refund handling, provider selection, and generation persistence.

## Manual Review

- Reviewed `packages/cloud/api/v1/generate-music/route.ts` and confirmed it delegates provider-specific work to the shared audio provider registry.
- Reviewed `packages/cloud/api/v1/generate-sfx/route.ts` and confirmed credit reservations are refunded when validation or provider execution fails.
- Reviewed `packages/cloud/shared/src/lib/providers/audio/elevenlabs-audio-generation.ts` and confirmed the binary audio response is persisted through the configured storage adapter.
- Reviewed `packages/cloud/shared/src/lib/providers/audio/fal-audio-generation.ts` and confirmed both FAL queue result shapes are normalized before returning to the API route.
- Reviewed `packages/cloud/shared/src/lib/services/ai-pricing/providers/sfx.ts` and confirmed the Stable Audio fallback uses the current FAL public price of `$0.20` per audio generation.

## N/A

- Live generated audio/SFX artifacts: N/A - tracked by #11745 because live provider credentials and spend are required.
- UI screenshots/video: N/A - this is a cloud API/shared provider change with no dashboard UI changes.
- Live LLM trajectories: N/A - no agent prompt/model behavior changed.
