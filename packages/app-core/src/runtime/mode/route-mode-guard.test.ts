/**
 * Coverage for the route-mode gate decision, focused on the fail-closed
 * drift guard added for arch-audit #12633.
 *
 * We exercise the pure `evaluateRouteModeGate` (mode passed explicitly, no
 * disk/snapshot mocking) so the assertions are deterministic and order-
 * independent when run alongside the rest of the mode suite. It asserts:
 *   - un-enumerated children of a protected namespace are still gated by the
 *     catch-all prefix rule (hidden in the namespace's excluded modes);
 *   - handler-declared plugin route `modes` win over the static matrix;
 *   - paths outside any protected namespace pass through (default-allow);
 *   - the fail-closed branch fires (hidden) for a protected path that no
 *     rule governs.
