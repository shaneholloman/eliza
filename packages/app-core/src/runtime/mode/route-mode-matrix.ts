/**
 * Mode-visibility matrix for HTTP API routes.
 *
 * Legacy fallback matrix for host-owned HTTP API routes that cannot yet carry
 * mode visibility on their route declaration. Plugin-owned routes should set
 * `Route.modes`; the route-mode guard consults registered runtime routes
 * before this table. A request to a route that does not include the active
 * mode returns 404 (hidden, not forbidden).
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Modes are matched against `getRuntimeMode()` (see runtime-mode.ts).
 *   - "local" implicitly does NOT include "local-only" — list both
 *     explicitly when a route is allowed in both. This keeps the table
 *     skim-readable.
 *   - A route accessible in zero modes is dead code: delete it.
 *   - The matcher prefers an exact pathname match, falls back to
 *     longest-prefix match. Method may be "*" to apply to all verbs.
 *
 * AGENTS.md §1 contract:
 *   - cloud mode hides every local-model surface and every
 *     `/api/local-inference/*` endpoint.
 *   - local-only hides every cloud-routed surface (`/api/cloud/*`,
 *     `/api/tts/cloud`).
 *   - remote mode runs no model surface itself — every model setting maps
 *     to the target. Local-inference and cloud are NOT exposed by the
 *     controller; the controller proxies to the target instead.
