/**
 * Guard for the sign-in surface safe-area contract (#15361).
 *
 * On the installed iOS standalone PWA the login view rendered a black band at
 * the top (the `--launch-bg` FOUC guard showing through the status-bar zone)
 * PLUS a pushed-down card. Two facts drive the fix:
 *
 *   1. The `body.desktop { padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top) }` rule the
 *      issue suspected is Electrobun-DESKTOP only (added by
 *      `initializeDesktopShell()`); it is NOT present on the installed iOS PWA.
 *      The standalone-PWA CSS blocks (base.css / styles.css) apply the
 *      scroll-lock + height geometry but NO body-level top safe-area padding.
 *   2. This `/login` route renders through `CloudRouterShell` (a public route),
 *      NOT the `App.tsx` catch-all shell column — so it does NOT inherit the
 *      shell column's `paddingTop: max(calc(var(--safe-area-top)..))`.
 *
 * So the login page is the SINGLE owner of the top inset on its own surface.
 * The correct shape is therefore:
 *   - EXACTLY ONE `env(safe-area-inset-top)` inset (the content padding), and
 *   - a `fixed inset-0` `bg-bg` underlay so the background fills edge-to-edge
 *     under the status bar (no black band) instead of a collapsed
 *     `min-h-[100dvh]` slab that starts at the layout-viewport top.
 *
 * This is a source-level scan (jsdom cannot resolve `env()` / device viewport
 * collapse), matching the established App.safe-area-fill.test.ts idiom.
