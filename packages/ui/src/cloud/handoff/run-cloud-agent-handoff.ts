 * terminal status the supervisor returns (or `failed` if it throws).
 *
 * On a non-success terminal phase (`timed-out`/`failed`) it arms a one-shot
 * retry: a {@link CLOUD_HANDOFF_RETRY_EVENT} for this `agentId` re-invokes
 * `start`. The supervisor's import is idempotent, so retrying is safe and the
 * user is never silently stranded on the shared adapter — the failure stays
 * visible with a retry instead of being swallowed (the old
 * `startCloudAgentHandoff(...).catch(() => {})`).
 *
 * `start` is a thunk so the caller owns the supervisor args (agent id, bases,
 * token, `onSwitch` rebind) and this module stays decoupled + unit-testable.
 *
 * `onSwitchSucceeded` is the gated success hook (PR4): it fires ONLY on a
 * terminal `switched`/`switched-empty` — i.e. the dedicated is confirmed live
 * and the transcript was copied + the client repointed onto it. It is the ONLY
 * safe moment to delete the transient shared bridge; on `timed-out`/`failed`
 * (or a thrown supervisor) the user is STILL on the shared adapter, so the hook
 * is deliberately NOT called and the shared bridge is kept. Best-effort: a
 * throw here is swallowed (a failed shared-delete just leaks a row — never
 * un-switches the user).
