/**
 * Organization domain barrel (app-hosted Eliza Cloud).
 *
 * Members + invites management with RBAC owner > admin > member. Lifted from
 * `@elizaos/cloud-frontend/src/dashboard/settings/_components/.../organization`
 * and rewired onto the app's shared cloud infra (typed `api` client +
 * React-Query + cloud route registry + cloud i18n).
 *
 * Consumers:
 * - the Wave-3 settings agent registers {@link OrganizationSection} (zero-arg,
 *   self-loading) into the settings-section registry.
 * - the cloud router shell mounts the standalone route by side-effect of
 *   importing `./routes` (which calls `registerCloudRoute("dashboard/organization")`).
 *
 * Single-org reality: a user belongs to exactly one organization. Accepting an
 * invite *moves* the invitee to this org (it does not add a second membership);
 * the invite dialog copy surfaces that explicitly.
 */
