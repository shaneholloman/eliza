/**
 * Shared shell for the standalone console pages mounted by the cloud router at
 * the apex console (elizacloud.ai), where the in-app Settings view never
 * mounts. Every one of these pages was an independent thin wrapper that
 * repeated the exact same container (`mx-auto w-full max-w-4xl px-4 py-6
 * md:px-6 md:py-8`) around a self-loading surface, and most also repeated the
 * `useDocumentTitle(t(key, { defaultValue }))` boilerplate. Two copies of one
 * layout that can only drift; this centralizes both so the page container and
 * the title-setting convention live in a single place.
 *
 * Behavior-preserving: pages that set a document title pass `titleKey` +
 * `titleDefault`; pages whose surface sets its own title (or which have no
 * title) simply omit them — the title effect is not mounted at all in that
 * case, exactly as before (those pages never called `useDocumentTitle`). No
 * local `PageHeaderProvider` is introduced — the surface's `useSetPageHeader`
 * must reach `ConsoleShell`'s provider, exactly as before.
