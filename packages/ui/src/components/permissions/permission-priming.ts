 *  1. Which permissions to prime, per platform, as an explicit crash-guarded
 *     allowlist (never a loop over PERMISSION_IDS — that would hard-crash iOS on
 *     an unentitled request; see the platform table below).
 *  2. The plain-language rationale copy shown in each soft-ask card, before any
 *     OS dialog is triggered.
 *  3. The persisted "already primed" flag so the modal shows once and can be
 *     re-triggered from Settings.
 *
 * The soft-ask contract: the OS permission dialog is only ever fired when the
 * user taps "Enable" on a card. Priming a permission here does NOT request it —
 * it only decides that a rationale card is worth showing.
