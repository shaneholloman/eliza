 * Mounted as a shell-root sibling (next to FirstRunConductorMount /
 * TutorialConductorMount) and self-gates — it renders `null` unless:
 *  - the user is authenticated (post-login; local resolves silently, cloud
 *    clears LoginView),
 *  - first-run has completed (`firstRunComplete !== false`), so the in-chat
 *    onboarding lock is already released and there is nothing to collide with,
 *  - the tutorial is not active (the chat-native tour owns the conversation
 *    right after onboarding — priming waits its turn instead of covering it),
 *  - the platform has a non-empty priming set (web is intentionally empty), and
 *  - it hasn't already been shown (persisted flag; re-trigger lives in Settings).
