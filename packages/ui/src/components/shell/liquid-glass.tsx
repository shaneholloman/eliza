/**
 * Liquid-glass recipe for the chat sheet: a specular rim + inner bevel on top
 * of the existing frosted (blur/saturate) surface.
 *
 * "Liquid glass" reads from the edge, not the fill: a bright specular hairline
 * along the top rim, a soft interior bevel, and a gentle bottom vignette give
 * the panel the depth of a real glass slab lit from above. Full-surface SVG
 * displacement (feTurbulence -> feDisplacementMap) on `backdrop-filter` smears
 * a panel this large into a dark wobble and shimmers over the live ember field.
 * Edge-only refraction needs an edge-masked displacement or a real normal map;
 * until that exists, the rim + bevel + sheen carry the look without per-frame
 * filter cost.
 *
 * Consumed by ContinuousChatOverlay (the inset sheet surface). Values are
 * neutral white/black only (no accent, no blue), and depth is inset light with
 * no outer drop shadow per the shell's flat surface system.
