/**
 * Safely open an `EventSource`.
 *
 * The browser `EventSource` constructor only accepts http(s) URLs and throws a
 * synchronous `SecurityError: The operation is insecure` for any other scheme.
 * The iOS on-device agent is addressed through the `eliza-local-agent://ipc`
 * base, whose SSE routes are served over the native IPC bridge rather than a
 * real socket — so constructing an `EventSource` against it crashes whatever
 * surface mounted the subscription (e.g. the home model-status hook), which is
 * how the local-agent chat surface fell over with "The operation is insecure."
 *
 * Returning `null` (instead of throwing) lets callers degrade to their
 * fetch/poll path. `null` is also returned when `EventSource` is unavailable or
 * the URL is unparseable, so callers only need a single nullish check.
