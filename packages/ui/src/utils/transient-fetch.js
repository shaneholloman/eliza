/**
 * Recognise transient fetch failures that should NOT be surfaced as a console
 * warning during best-effort startup/hydration work. Two shapes:
 *
 *  - the app's `ApiError` with `kind === "network"` and a message of
 *    "Failed to fetch" / "Request aborted" (a request that never got an HTTP
 *    response — connection reset, navigation away, server still starting);
 *  - the app's `ApiError` with `kind === "timeout"` (the request was made but
 *    the server was briefly too slow to respond under boot load — a heavy dev
 *    cold-start can blow the per-request timeout; a later poll succeeds); and
 *  - a raw `TypeError: Failed to fetch` / "NetworkError" / "Load failed"
 *    (fetch() rejecting before any response — same root cause, but the call
 *    site didn't wrap it in an ApiError).
 *
 * Every fetch that is "best effort and re-driven by a later poll" can use this
 * to decide whether a failure is worth logging. It is NOT for fetches whose
 * failure is a real bug — only for the optional hydration ones.
