 *
 * The gate was bypassed only for `startupCoordinator.phase ===

 * advanced past `first-run-required` while onboarding is still incomplete (e.g.
 * a cloud pick moved startup into a provisioning/hydrating phase while the
 * conductor's cloud-OAuth block is still up) — both login surfaces mounted.
 *

 * `firstRunComplete === false` counts as active: a loading (`undefined` / not
 * yet known) or completed (`true`) state must NOT suppress the gate, so a
 * normal unauthenticated session still gets the top-level login.
