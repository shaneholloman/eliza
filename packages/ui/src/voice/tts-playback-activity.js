 * cooldown after it ends, the always-on capture raises its speech thresholds
 * so the agent's own tail can't self-trigger an ASR submission.
 *
 * The playback-frame pump sessions (playback-frame-pump.ts) bracket real
 * audible playback on the local-inference/cloud paths, so they mark this
 * signal on start/stop; the local ASR capture's auto-stop detector reads it.
 * All timestamps are in the renderer's `performance.now()` domain. Pure
 * module state, no DOM.
