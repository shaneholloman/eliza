/**
 * Always-mounted bridge for chat-driven voice preferences.
 *
 * The SETTINGS voice twin persists `messages.voice` through `/api/config`, but
 * the capture hot path (useShellController.startCapture) and ChatView read the
 * localStorage mirrors (loadVadAutoStop / loadContinuousChatMode) that
 * VoiceSectionMount seeds — never the config blob, and only on its own mount.
 * This hook subscribes to the `voice-settings:apply` broadcast the action emits
 * after a successful config write and re-seeds those same mirrors, so a
 * chat-driven change reaches the running shell without a Settings → Voice
 * remount or an app reload. It is the voice twin of useAppearanceApplyChannel.
 *
 * Payload fields are validated before they touch the mirrors: a crafted or
 * partial broadcast can only ever write a known continuous mode or a fully
 * numeric VAD pair, never a malformed value into the capture path.
