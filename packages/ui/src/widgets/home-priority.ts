 * Home-widget priority ranking (#9143).
 *
 * The frontpage/home surface must NOT render every `home`-slot widget — it
 * should surface only the highest-importance widgets *right now*, the way a
 * phone home screen bubbles up what needs attention. This module is the pure
 * ranking core: it scores each home widget by a stable base priority plus any
 * recent attention/activity signals (decayed by recency), then returns the
 * top-N ordered by current importance.
 *
 * It is deliberately decoupled from React and from how signals are sourced:
 * callers (the home WidgetHost) map their live `ActivityEvent` stream into
 * {@link HomeWidgetSignal}s and pass `now` in, so the function is pure and
 * deterministic (no `Date.now()` in a render path — see the UI determinism
 * gate). The signal→widget attribution and event-stream wiring live in the
 * consumer, not here.
