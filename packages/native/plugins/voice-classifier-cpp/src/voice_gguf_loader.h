/*
 * voice-classifier-cpp — internal GGUF metadata + tensor loader.
 *
 * Not exported in the public C ABI; consumed only by the per-head TUs
 * inside this library. Each head's `*_open` calls
 * `voice_gguf_load_metadata(path, "voice_<head>", &meta)` and then
 * validates the fields it cares about against its locked contract.
 *
 * For heads that actually run a forward graph (emotion as of J1.a-forward),
 * `voice_gguf_open` extends the metadata-only path: it mmap's the file,
 * parses the tensor descriptor block, and exposes a flat lookup table
 * the per-head TU walks at session-open time.
 *
 * The metadata struct is intentionally a flat set of the keys the
 * four heads can share. Per-head extensions (e.g. the diarizer's
 * `frames_per_window`) live as additional fields with their own
 * default-zero semantics — a head that doesn't set a key sees zero
 * and uses its own constant.
