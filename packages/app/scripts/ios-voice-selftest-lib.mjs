/**
 * Pure verdict logic for the iOS simulator voice round-trip lane
 * (`ios-voice-selftest-smoke.mjs`). Kept dependency-free so it is the single
 * source of truth for "did the REAL mic->ASR->agent->TTS loop pass?" shared by
 * the in-app WKWebView verifier (which mirrors this check to signal early) and
 * the host-side orchestrator (which re-derives the verdict from the raw report
 * as the authoritative hard gate), and unit-tested by
 * `ios-voice-selftest-lib.test.mjs`.
 *
 * The no-false-green contract matches `voice-selftest.android.spec.ts`: overall
 * must be `pass` AND each of the asr/send/tts stages must be `pass`. A `skipped`
 * stage (e.g. local-inference ASR not provisioned) is NOT a pass — it fails the
 * lane loudly so "can't run here" never reads as "verified working".
