/**
 * Cloud first-run ends with a "Restart Eliza" CTA whose path ultimately
 * lands in `DesktopManager.relaunch()` (see
 * `eliza/packages/app-core/platforms/electrobun/src/native/desktop.ts:1439`).
 * That handler calls `Bun.spawn([process.execPath, ...process.argv.slice(1)])`
 * and then `Utils.quit()`. On packaged builds `process.execPath` resolves to
 * the launcher binary inside the .app/.exe bundle — if that binary is missing
 * or unreadable the spawn fails. The handler swallows the error via
 * `logger.error(...)` but the process still exits, so a regression that
 * resolves `execPath` to a non-existent path manifests as: shell quits, no
 * new instance comes up. This e2e drives the actual menu action through the
 * loopback test bridge and asserts the parent process exits cleanly without
 * a crash signal.
 *
 * Gated on macOS/Windows — the test requires a packaged launcher binary
 * (the only host configurations where one is built in CI).
