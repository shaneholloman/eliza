/**
 * What each builtin view's pixels must show to count as correctly rendered.
 *
 * Seeded from the real OCR of the committed all-views capture, so every label
 * here is one the packaged engine actually reads off a healthy render. Labels are
 * chosen for OCR stability — short, high-contrast chrome text ("Ask Eliza",
 * "Settings", section headers) rather than long body copy that garbles — and kept
 * deliberately loose (`requireAny` for time-of-day/empty-vs-populated states) so a
 * legitimate state change never trips the gate. Absence of an entry means the view
 * is only checked for the universal defects (blank pixels, developer-string leak,
 * placeholder text); presence lets a matched render earn a positive `verified`.
 *
 * Keyed by the capture slug (filename without extension). Third-party `plugin-*`
 * views are intentionally absent — they own their content and are checked only for
 * the universal defects.
