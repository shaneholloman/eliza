// NOTE: this config intentionally has no `webServer`. The packaged Electrobun
// e2e suite expects the app binary to be built out-of-band before invocation
// (via `bun run build` at the workspace root, which transitively builds
// `@elizaos/shared`'s dist). Driving a clean prod build from `webServer.command`
// has historically failed when `@elizaos/shared`'s `dist/` is missing because
// the package's `main`/`exports` only resolve once `bun run build` has produced
// `packages/shared/dist/index.js`. If you need a green run without an existing
// build, run `bun run --cwd packages/shared build` first, or skip this suite
// (`PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_PACKAGED=1`) and rely on `playwright.ui-smoke.config.ts`
// which points at the dev stack (`packages/app-core/scripts/playwright-ui-live-stack.ts`).
