"""Canonical xorshift32 PRNG for the PolarQuant QJL residual sign vector.

This is the Python port of the C reference implementation that lives in:

    eliza/packages/native/plugins/polarquant-cpu/src/polar_qjl.c
    eliza/plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/verify/qjl_polar_ref.c
        (eliza_polar_qjl_signs)

Per packages/training/AGENTS.md S3 ("kernel side wins") the C reference is
canonical. The Python recipe must produce a sign sequence that is bit-exact
with what the on-device decoder will compute. xorshift32 was chosen on the C
side because:

    - it has a 32-bit state (trivially portable across CPU / Metal / Vulkan /
      CUDA kernels);
    - it produces a deterministic, version-stable bit stream;
    - the algorithm fits in 3 shifts + 3 xors per step, easy to inline.

The C inner loop is:

    state ^= state << 13;
    state ^= state >> 17;
    state ^= state << 5;
    out[i] = (state & 1u) ? +1.0f : -1.0f;

The state must be non-zero (xorshift collapses to 0). Seed 0 is rewritten to 1
in both C sources. We do the same here.

Seed 42 is the canonical value used by both C reference files and is mirrored
in :data:`polarquant.polar_quant._QJL_SEED`.
