"""DEPRECATED — use ``packages/training/scripts/publish/publish_model.py``.

Historically two paths existed for pushing a trained eliza-1 checkpoint to
HuggingFace:

  - ``scripts/push_model_to_hf.py``               (this file, legacy)
  - ``scripts/publish/publish_eliza1_model_repo.py``  (canonical bundle uploader)

The audit (wave1/huggingface.md §6.3, training.md §3.1) flagged this as
duplicate. The canonical bundle uploader is the only path called by the
publish orchestrator. This file is now a thin redirect.

Callers should switch to::

    python -m scripts.publish.publish_model --checkpoint <dir> [--bundle-dir <dir>] ...

or, if a fully-staged bundle is on disk::

    python -m scripts.publish.orchestrator --bundle-dir <dir> --tier <tier>
