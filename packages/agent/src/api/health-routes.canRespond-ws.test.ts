/**
 * WS `status` wire-contract guard for `canRespond` (fix for #8777: the WS status
 * broadcast omitted `canRespond`, so every 5s broadcast — and every (re)connect
 * — reset the client's `agentStatus.canRespond` to `undefined` and re-gated the
 * chat composer back to "waking up").
 *
 * Booting the full `startApiServer` to assert the live WS payload is not viable
 * in this vitest lane: `server.ts` imports `@elizaos/app-core/api/cloud-pair-route`
 * (and other subpaths) which the package's `@elizaos/app-core` test alias rewrites
 * to a non-directory path (ENOTDIR), so the module graph fails to load. No
 * committed agent test imports `server.ts` for that reason.
 *
 * Instead this pins the derivation that BOTH WS payload sites in `server.ts`
 * (the initial-connect status at the `wss.on("connection")` handler, and the
 * 5s `broadcastStatus`) compute via the SAME `computeCanRespond(state.runtime,
 * state.agentState)` call that `/api/status` and `/api/health` use. Exhaustively
 * locking every `(runtime, agentState)` combination the broadcast depends on
 * catches a regression in the readiness signal those payloads carry. The
 * presence-on-the-wire half (that the field is serialized at all) is covered by
 * the `canRespond:` literals threaded through the three call sites in
 * `health-routes.ts` / `server.ts` and asserted structurally below: the function
 * always returns a strict `boolean`, never `undefined`.
