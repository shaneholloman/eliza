/**
 * Boot-time integration seam between the TEE confidential-inference unseal path
 * (`tee-confidential-inference.ts`) and the local model runtime (plan §2.2).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A HELPER, NOT AN ALWAYS-ON BOOT CALL: weights loading lives in the
 * `@elizaos/plugin-local-inference` llama.cpp fork, not in the agent's
 * boot/runtime path. The agent never reads `*.gguf`/`*.safetensors` itself, so
 * there is no clean in-process seam in `runtime/eliza.ts` to gate. Rather than
 * fabricate a fake consumer, this module exposes the one function the
 * local-inference boot WILL call right before it hands weight bytes to the
 * runtime, behind the {@link CONFIDENTIAL_WEIGHTS_ENV} flag and inert by default.
 *
 * INTEGRATION (one line, to be added by the local-model runtime boot):
 *
 *     const confidential = await prepareConfidentialModelWeights({
 *       keyReleaseClient,            // HttpTeeKeyReleaseClient (prod) / LocalTeeKeyReleaseClient (dev)
 *       policy: teeBootGate.policy,  // the boot-gate's resolved + production-merged policy
 *       sealedWeights,               // the at-rest AES-256-GCM weights blob
 *       requiredMeasurements: [...], // agent, policy, container, os, npuFirmware, modelWeights
 *     });
 *     // confidential === undefined  -> flag off; load cleartext weights as before
 *     // confidential.weights        -> decrypted-in-memory bytes; hand to runtime, then zeroize
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED: when {@link CONFIDENTIAL_WEIGHTS_ENV} is set, this never returns
 * cleartext weights without a passing attestation. It refuses (throws) when the
 * one-time boot gate already blocked secrets, then delegates to
 * {@link unsealModelWeights} which only decrypts after the key-release client's
 * evidence satisfies the policy. The decrypted weights/key never touch disk,
 * env, or the structured logger (enforced by `tee-secret-hygiene.test.ts`).
