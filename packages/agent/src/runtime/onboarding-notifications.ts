/**
 * First-run onboarding notifications — seeds the notification inbox with a few
 * getting-started pointers ("Take the tour", "Get help", "Connect your
 * calendar") exactly once per agent, so a fresh install's dashboard
 * notification center opens as a guide instead of never appearing (the widget
 * self-hides on an empty inbox).
 *
 * Seeding goes through the canonical NotificationService (persisted per-agent,
 * broadcast on the agent event bus), so the rows behave like every other
 * notification: dismissing one deletes it server-side and it never returns —
 * the once-only guard is a separate cache flag, NOT the rows themselves, so a
 * user who clears their inbox is not re-onboarded on the next boot.
