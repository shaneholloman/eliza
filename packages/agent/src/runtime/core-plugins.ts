 * an action the model must be able to select, or a service/event listener with

 *   - app-control     — app launch/close/list actions
 *   - shell           — shell service + shell-history provider

 * The genuinely on-demand connector/feature plugins that have NO boot
 * obligation (e.g. plugin-video — service-only, reached via getService(VIDEO);
 * and the orchestrator's task-coordinator companion — views-only metadata) are
 * not in this core set: they enter via plugin-collector only when configured,

 * that a lazy import could avoid (their server modules import only `type`-level
 * symbols). The heaviest deferred imports measured (agent-orchestrator,
 * shell, coding-tools, commands) all register providers/actions or eager-start
 * event-subscribing services and therefore must stay at boot. See
 * benchmarks/loadperf/research/03-agent-boot-plugins.md.

 * this set: startEliza() returns startInCloudMode() before the deferred-boot
