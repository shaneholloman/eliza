        `You are an adversarial verifier. Read the continual-learning benchmark JSON at \`${BASE}/${v.name}/continual_benchmark.json\`.

This run trained learners sequentially on a 4-task continual benchmark; for each (learner, seed) the JSON's \`results\` list has an entry {name, matrix (TxT), baseline, metrics, seed}. \`matrix[i][j]\` = eval return on task j after training phase i.

Do NOT trust the reported \`metrics\`/\`summary\`. Independently recompute, for the PRIMARY learner "${v.learner}" (averaged over its seeds), using numpy via the repo venv (\`cd packages/research/robot && JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu .venv/bin/python\`):
  - ACC = mean_j R[T-1][j]
  - BWT = mean_{j<T-1} (R[T-1][j] - R[j][j])
  - Forgetting = mean_{j<T-1} max(0, max_{j<=l<T} R[l][j] - R[T-1][j])
  - mean_diagonal = mean_j R[j][j]   (how well each task was learned the moment it finished training)
  - mean_final = mean_j R[T-1][j]    (retained performance at end of stream)
Also read the reported summary mean for acc/bwt/forgetting for "${v.learner}", and extract ppo's reported mean ACC from the same JSON (for cross-run consistency).

Set matches_reported=true iff your recomputed acc/bwt/forgetting agree with the reported means within 0.5 absolute. Report seeds = number of seeds for the primary learner. Be precise; this is variant "${v.name}" (${v.label}).`,

  `You are synthesizing the Alberta continual-learning RETENTION tournament. Here are the independently re-verified results (one per variant), as JSON:

${JSON.stringify(ok, null, 2)}

Context: the question is whether a nonlinear MLP+Continual-Backprop controller can match the linear sparse_gated controller's near-zero forgetting while having MORE capacity (better per-task learning), and beat PPO. "Retention" = low Forgetting / BWT near 0. "Capacity" = high mean_diagonal (how well each task is learned). The reference points are variant "linear" (the lookup that retains perfectly but is capacity-limited) and ppo.

Evaluate these headline claims and mark each holds/true-or-false with concrete numbers as evidence:
1. cbp_frozen retains: its Forgetting <= linear.Forgetting + 1.0 AND BWT >= -1.5.
2. The retention mechanism matters: cbp_frozen Forgetting is much lower than cbp_none Forgetting.
3. Nonlinear capacity beats the linear lookup: cbp_frozen mean_diagonal >= linear mean_diagonal.
4. cbp_frozen beats the PPO baseline on ACC: cbp_frozen ACC > ppo ACC.
5. Harness sanity: ppo ACC is consistent across all runs (same seeds/env) — set ppo_consistent accordingly (within ~0.5).
6. Also report the plastic-trunk tradeoff: cbp_multihead vs cbp_frozen on ACC and Forgetting.

Pick the overall winner (the variant that best combines retention + capacity + beating ppo). Then write \`report_markdown\`: a concise, honest markdown report with (a) a results table (variant | ACC | BWT | Forgetting | mean_diagonal[capacity] | mean_final[retained]), (b) the claim checks with numbers, (c) the plasticity/retention tradeoff in plain language, (d) any caveats (2 seeds = noisy; toy joint_reach env). Do not overclaim. Set verdict to a one-paragraph bottom line.`,
