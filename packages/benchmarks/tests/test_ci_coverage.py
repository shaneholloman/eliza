"""Every public benchmark must declare a CI lane (#9475, #10193).

This is the de-larp guard: the suite advertised "40+ benchmarks" while nearly
every one had zero scheduled real-model runs. This test makes the CI-coverage
classification in ``orchestrator/ci_coverage.py`` stay 1:1 with registered
benchmarks plus public orchestrator adapters, so a new benchmark cannot be added
or exposed without an explicit CI lane (``scheduled`` / ``smoke``) or an explicit
``manual``-only marker — no benchmark silently gets zero CI coverage.

It also pins the classified-benchmark count to the live registry + adapter set
(#10193 trust): the prose in the sources previously undercounted what is really
44 registered / 53 public benchmarks, and this test makes any future hardcoded
"N-out-of-old-total" count in the classification module fail loudly.
