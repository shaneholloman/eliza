/**
 * GET /api/v1/apps-ingress/ask?domain=<host>
 *
 * Caddy on-demand-TLS `ask` endpoint for the apps front door. Before issuing a
 * Let's Encrypt cert for a host, the app node's Caddy calls this with the
 * requested SNI in `?domain=`. We return **200** iff that host is one of:
 *   1. the system `<shortid>.apps.elizacloud.ai` host of a RUNNING / deploying
 *      app container (exact `containers.public_hostname` match), or
 *   2. a user's own **verified, active custom domain** bound to an active,
 *      approved app (e.g. `elocute.fun`) — mirroring the reviewed predicate in
 *      `/api/v1/domains/resolve`. DNS-TXT verification is the ownership proof, so
 *      an attacker can't authorize a cert for a domain they don't control.
 * Anything else 404s, so Caddy never spams Let's Encrypt for hosts we don't own.
 *
 * PUBLIC + side-effect-free: it only reveals whether a given host maps to a live
 * app, which the DNS already implies. (Hardening — a per-node token / IP
 * allowlist — is tracked in #8321.) Fails CLOSED: on a lookup error we deny the
 * cert rather than authorize one we can't verify.
