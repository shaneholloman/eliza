/**
 * Voice Jobs API (v1)
 *
 * GET /api/v1/voice/jobs
 * Gets all active voice cloning jobs.
 * Supports both session and API key authentication.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS:
 * ----------------
 * 1. ASYNC JOB MONITORING: Voice cloning (especially professional quality) takes time.
 *    This endpoint lets applications poll for completion status programmatically.
 *
 * 2. WORKFLOW INTEGRATION: CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows need to wait for
 *    voice cloning to complete before proceeding to next steps (e.g., deploying
 *    an agent with a newly cloned voice).
 *
 * 3. ERROR HANDLING: Applications can detect failed jobs and implement retry logic
 *    or alert users about quality issues with their audio samples.
