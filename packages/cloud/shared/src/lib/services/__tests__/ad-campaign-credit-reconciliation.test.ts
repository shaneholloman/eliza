/**
 * Ad-campaign budget credit reconciliation on update + delete (#10265).
 *
 * createCampaign charges budget*markup up front (stored as credits_allocated).
 * Two money leaks were fixed:
 *
 *  - deleteCampaign refunded `credits_allocated - credits_spent`, but
 *    credits_spent is never written, so every delete refunded 100% of the
 *    prepaid budget + markup regardless of real ad spend ("free advertising").
 *    The fix refunds only the UNUSED fraction, derived from the real recorded
 *    spend (total_spend / budget_amount) scaled by credits_allocated.
 *
 *  - updateCampaign pushed a new budget LIVE to the ad platform but charged
 *    nothing for an increase and refunded nothing for a decrease. The fix
 *    charges the credit delta BEFORE pushing an increase live (fail-CLOSED on
 *    insufficient balance — never calls the platform), refunds the delta if the
 *    platform then rejects the increase, and refunds a decrease after the
 *    platform accepts it. A name-only change charges/refunds nothing.
 *
 * Tests the REAL advertisingService; only the repository, credentials, provider,
 * and creditsService boundaries are spied (no `mock.module`, so nothing leaks).
