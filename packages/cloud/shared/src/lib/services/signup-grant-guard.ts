/**
 * Anti-sybil guard for free welcome-bonus grants.
 *
 * New orgs receive INITIAL_FREE_CREDITS on signup (steward-sync + wallet-signup).
 * Without a per-IP cap this is a free metered-inference faucet: an attacker can
 * mint unlimited orgs from one host and farm the bonus. This caps the number of
 * free grants per source IP per day, mirroring the IP_RATE_LIMITS anti-sybil
 * pattern in `token-redemption-secure.ts` (which guards the redemption side).
 *
 * The grant sites record `metadata.ip_address` on each grant so this count is
 * meaningful; when no IP is known the check falls open (cannot attribute).
 *
 * CONCURRENCY: the cap is enforced under a per-IP advisory transaction lock so
 * N concurrent same-IP signups cannot each read `count < cap` before any of
 * them commit (a TOCTOU that would let every racer mint the bonus). The COUNT
 * and the grant run inside ONE transaction that holds
 * `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('free_grant:' + ip))` for its whole duration,
 * the same per-key advisory-lock serialization the redeemable-earnings promo
 * guard (`redeemable-earnings.ts`) uses for double-spend prevention. A second
 * racer for the same IP blocks on the lock until the first commits its grant
 * row, then re-counts and sees it — so the cap holds across concurrency.
