/**
 * SECURITY (H4, #12882 / #12230): pin the forwarded per-request database
 * identity to trusted control-plane context.
 *
 * The container-control-plane sidecar accepts an `x-eliza-cloud-database-url`
 * header and, when present, runs the request inside
 * `runWithCloudBindingsAsync({ DATABASE_URL })` -- i.e. it will connect to
 * whatever Postgres URL the caller names and even mirror/write Docker-node rows
 * into it. On its own that is an attacker-controlled tenant/database identity:
 * anyone who can reach the sidecar with the internal token could point it at a
 * database they control (data exfil, forged node rows), pivot to an internal DB
 * it should never touch, OR -- even on the *same* Postgres host:port -- connect
 * as a different user or to a different database/schema (`…:5432/exfil` instead
 * of `…:5432/cloud`).
 *
 * This guard makes that header FAIL CLOSED by pinning the WHOLE database
 * identity, not just the host. The legitimate control-plane forward
 * (`_container-control-plane-forward.ts`) sends the sidecar's OWN
 * `DATABASE_URL` verbatim, so the only value we ever need to honor is one that
 * matches the configured URL (or an explicit operator allowlist of full
 * DATABASE_URLs). A forwarded URL is honored only when its normalized identity
 * -- scheme, credentials, host, port, AND database path -- equals a trusted one.
 *
 * Anything else is rejected. A malformed forwarded URL is rejected. An
 * unparseable configured or allowlist URL does NOT silently widen the trust
 * set -- it is simply not added, so the guard stays closed.

/**
 * Normalize a database URL to a canonical identity key that pins the WHOLE
 * connection identity: scheme, username, password, host, port, and database
 * path. Two URLs get the same key iff they connect to the same database as the
 * same principal.
 *
 * Normalization is intentionally minimal and identity-preserving:
 *   - scheme + host are lowercased (case-insensitive per URL/DNS rules),
 *   - a missing port on a Postgres scheme is defaulted to 5432 (so
 *     `example/db` and `example:5432/db` are the same identity),
 *   - query parameters are canonicalized (sorted) and INCLUDED in the key.
 * The database path is compared EXACTLY (no trailing-slash stripping): the
 * Postgres parser treats `/cloud` and `/cloud/` as different database names, so
 * we must not collapse them and let a forwarded URL bind a different DB.
 * Username/password/database are compared exactly (NOT lowercased) -- those are
 * case-sensitive credentials/identifiers and must match precisely.
 *
 * Query params MUST be part of the identity: `pg-connection-string` honors
 * query fields like `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`, and `dbname` as
 * connection OVERRIDES, so a URL with a trusted host/path but
 * `?host=evil.example&user=attacker` would connect somewhere else entirely.
 * Because the legitimate control-plane forward sends the configured
 * `DATABASE_URL` verbatim, its (possibly empty) query set is exactly what the
 * pinned identity should require -- any extra/attacker query field changes the
 * key and fails closed.
 *
 * Returns `null` when the value can't be parsed as a URL, or when a *network*
 * scheme has no host (an unusable, untrustable identity). Host-less LOCAL
 * schemes (the documented file-backed PGlite form `pglite:///path`, plus
 * `sqlite:`/`file:`) are keyed on scheme + path so an identical local DB
 * still matches in dev/test.
