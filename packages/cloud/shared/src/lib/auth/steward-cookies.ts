 * over a SINGLE `steward-refresh-token` slot. Refresh tokens rotate on every
 * refresh, so whichever environment refreshed last overwrote the other's live
 * refresh token; the loser's next refresh 401'd and force-signed the user out
 * (#13728 — anyone with prod + staging tabs in one browser). Non-production
 * environments therefore suffix their cookie names with the environment;
 * production keeps the historical unsuffixed names so live sessions are
