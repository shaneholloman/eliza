/**
 * Heuristic end-of-turn (EOT) scoring — the single source of truth (#8786).
 *
 * The semantic "is the speaker done?" syntactic heuristic used to be implemented
 * twice with drifted behavior: the UI shell capture path
 * (`packages/ui/src/voice/end-of-turn.ts:scoreEndOfTurn`) and the plugin's
 * Tier-3 classifier (`plugin-local-inference .../voice/eot-classifier.ts:
 * HeuristicEotClassifier`). The two had diverged — different rule ORDERING
 * (the plugin scored a 2-word trail-off like "and so" as a complete short
 * command; the UI correctly held it), a missing ellipsis rule on the plugin
 * side, and a different question-tag set. This module is the one canonical
 * implementation both surfaces consume.
 *
 * It lives in `@elizaos/shared` (which both already depend on), is pure +
 * browser-safe (no Node deps), and ships via the `@elizaos/shared/voice-eot`
 * subpath without pulling the whole barrel — mirroring `voice-wer`.
 *
 * The fused composite EOT (ABI v11, `CompositeEotClassifier`) is preferred when
 * the loaded native build wires the semantic model; it blends THIS heuristic as
 * its high-precision syntactic co-signal, so consolidating here also feeds the
 * model path one definition.
