/**
 * Advanced Capabilities
 *
 * Extended functionality that can be enabled with `enableExtendedCapabilities: true`
 * or `advancedCapabilities: true` in plugin initialization.
 *
 * These provide additional agent features:
 * - Extended providers (facts, contacts, relationships, roles, settings, personality)
 * - Advanced actions (contacts management, room management, personality)
 *   Note: todos are owned entirely by @elizaos/plugin-todos (the `TODO` action +
 *   `currentTodosProvider` + DB-backed TodosService) and app-lifeops
 *   (`OWNER_TODOS`). Core registers no todos provider, service, or action.
 * - Registered post-turn evaluators (experience, skills, facts, relationships,
 *   identities, task success)
 * - Additional services (experience, personality)

// We deliberately bypass the local barrels (`./actions/index.ts`,
// `./evaluators/index.ts`, `./providers/index.ts`) and reach for each
// concrete file. Bun.build (1.3.13) collapses re-export-only barrels to
// empty `init_xxx = () => {}` shims AND simultaneously drops the underlying
// `var advancedContactsProvider = ...` declarations from the bundle when
// the only references to those symbols arrive through a `export * from` /
// `export { x }` chain. The runtime then throws
// `ReferenceError: advancedContactsProvider is not defined` the first time
// `advancedProviders` is touched. Importing directly from the leaf file
// gives Bun a real per-file consumer it cannot prune.
