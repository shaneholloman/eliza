/**
 * ResponseHandlerFieldEvaluator — registration pattern for the Stage-1 response
 * handler's structured output.
 *
 * The Stage-1 LLM call (`ModelType.RESPONSE_HANDLER`) populates a single flat
 * JSON object via the HANDLE_RESPONSE tool. Each top-level property of that
 * object is owned by a registered `ResponseHandlerFieldEvaluator`. The runtime:
 *
 *   1. Collects all registered evaluators (core + plugins).
 *   2. Filters by `shouldRun(ctx)` — per-turn activation gate.
 *   3. Composes ONE JSON schema (all active evaluators contribute one slice).
 *   4. Composes ONE prompt (each active evaluator contributes one slice).
 *   5. Calls the LLM once.
 *   6. Dispatches each parsed field value to its owning evaluator's
 *      `handle(value, ctx)` in priority order. Handlers mutate the
 *      MessageHandlerResult and may emit side effects (abort, retrieval,
 *      memory writes, etc).
 *
 * Schema stability for caching:
 *
 * - The composed schema is BYTE-STABLE across turns provided the registered
 *   set is stable. Plugin load is the only time the schema changes.
 * - `shouldRun` does NOT add or remove fields from the schema — it controls
 *   whether the field's prompt slice is included (so the LLM is instructed
 *   to populate it) and whether the field's handler runs after parse.
 *   The field stays declared in the schema (typed as the field's `schema` |
 *   the empty default), so the schema bytes are identical every turn.
 *
 * Required-by-default:
 *
 * - All fields are REQUIRED. The LLM must populate every field. For N/A
 *   the LLM emits the field's declared empty value (empty array, empty
 *   string, "IGNORE", etc.). This eliminates the "did the model skip this
 *   field?" failure mode and maps cleanly to OpenAI strict mode and
 *   Anthropic tool-use schema validation.
 *
 * Pipeline handler semantics:
 *
 * - Handlers run in priority order. Earlier handlers can short-circuit the
 *   rest by calling `ctx.preempt(reason)` — this is how abort works: the
 *   threadOps handler calls `runtime.abortTurn` and preempts, suppressing
 *   the subsequent route-to-planner step.
 * - Handlers receive the FULL parsed object plus their own field's value.
 *   They can read sibling values but should not mutate them — mutations
 *   go through the messageHandler result object.
