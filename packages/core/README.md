# @elizaos/core

## Overview

`@elizaos/core` is the runtime and contract layer of elizaOS. It defines the `AgentRuntime` and the plugin abstractions (actions, providers, evaluators, services, models, routes, events), the canonical type system, and the supporting subsystems (memory, search, settings, scheduling, prompts). It is consumed by `@elizaos/agent` (which also hosts the HTTP API server), `@elizaos/app-core` (the API + dashboard host), and every `@elizaos/*` plugin.

## Key concepts

- **AgentRuntime:** Central orchestrator for the agent lifecycle, plugin loading, and the message loop.
- **Actions:** Tasks the agent can perform, each with a `validate` and `handler` function.
- **Providers:** Supply data and context to the runtime and its components.
- **Evaluators:** Process conversation data to extract facts, build memory, and reflect.
- **Plugin system:** `Plugin` objects contribute actions/providers/evaluators/services to the runtime.
- **Built-in bundle:** Foundational capabilities ship as `basicCapabilities` (and `basicActions` / `basicProviders` / `basicEvaluators` / `basicServices`); there is no `corePlugin` singleton.

## Installation

1.  Add `@elizaos/core` to your `agent/package.json` dependencies:

    ```json
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "@elizaos/core": "workspace:*"
      }
    }
    ```

2.  Navigate to your `agent/` directory.
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
4.  Build your project:
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

## Build targets (Node, Browser, Edge)

`@elizaos/core` builds to three targets via conditional exports:

- **Node.js Build**: Full API surface with all features including server utilities (`index.node.ts`)
- **Browser Build**: Browser-safe subset, no fs/process-bound modules (`index.browser.ts`)
- **Edge Build**: Edge-runtime subset (`index.edge.ts`)

The correct build is automatically selected based on your environment through package.json conditional exports. For browser usage, ensure your app provides the standard platform primitives it depends on, such as `Buffer` where needed.

## Configuration

The following environment variables are used by `@elizaos/core`. Configure them in a `.env` file at your project root.

- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (e.g., 'debug', 'info', 'error').
- `LOG_JSON_FORMAT`: Output logs in JSON format (`true`/`false`).
- `SECRET_SALT`: Encryption salt, read by `getSalt()` in `src/settings.ts`. In production it must be set to a non-default value unless `ELIZA_ALLOW_DEFAULT_SECRET_SALT=true`.
- `ALLOW_NO_DATABASE`: Allow running without a persistent database adapter. When `true`, `AgentRuntime.initialize()` will fall back to an in-memory adapter (useful for benchmarks/tests).
- `LOG_FILE`: When set to `true`/`1` or a path, enables file logging: `output.log`, `prompts.log`, and `chat.log` (in cwd or at the given path). **Why:** Lets you inspect full prompts and chat flow without scraping console; ANSI is stripped so files stay grep-friendly.
- `BASIC_CAPABILITIES_KEEP_RESP`: When `true`, the message service does not discard a response when a newer message is being processed (avoids "stale reply" race). **Why:** Some deployments want to keep or display every response; this is the config equivalent of passing `keepExistingResponses: true` in options.
- `SHOULD_RESPOND_MODEL`: Which model size to use for the "should I respond?" decision (`small` or `large`, read in `src/services/message.ts`). Defaults from runtime settings if not set in options.
- `ELIZA_TRAJECTORY_LOGGING`: Canonical trajectory persistence knob. Truthy values (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`) enable file and DB trajectory recording; non-empty falsey values disable it; blank is treated as unset. When unset, recording is on for local/dev and unset `NODE_ENV`, but off for `NODE_ENV=test` and `NODE_ENV=production` unless explicitly enabled.
- `ELIZA_TRAJECTORY_RECORDING`: Legacy alias honored only when `ELIZA_TRAJECTORY_LOGGING` is unset.
- `ELIZA_DISABLE_TRAJECTORY_LOGGING=1`: Hard opt-out that wins over both trajectory enable knobs.

**Example `.env`:**

```plaintext
LOG_LEVEL=debug
LOG_JSON_FORMAT=false
SECRET_SALT=yourSecretSaltHere
ALLOW_NO_DATABASE=true
LOG_FILE=true
```

**Note:** Add your `.env` file to `.gitignore` to protect sensitive information.

### Design and rationale (WHY)

Per-change notes with the WHY for each addition or fix live in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). The sections below document the reasoning behind the major subsystems so future changes stay consistent with intent.

### Benchmark & Trajectory Tracing

Trajectory persistence is controlled by `ELIZA_TRAJECTORY_LOGGING`: dev/local defaults on, while `NODE_ENV=test` and `NODE_ENV=production` default off unless explicitly opted in. Blank values are treated as unset so empty `.env` entries do not silently disable local recording.

Benchmarks and harnesses can attach metadata to inbound messages:

- `message.metadata.trajectoryStepId`: when present, provider access + model calls are captured for that step.
- `message.metadata.benchmarkContext`: when present, the `CONTEXT_BENCH` provider sets `state.values.benchmark_has_context=true`, and the message loop forces action-based execution (so the full Provider → Model → Action → Evaluator loop is exercised).

### Model output contract (XML preferred, plain text tolerated)

The canonical message loop expects model outputs in the `<response>...</response>` XML format (with `<actions>`, `<providers>`, and `<text>` fields).

Some deterministic/offline backends may return **plain text** instead. In that case, the runtime will treat the raw output as a simple **`REPLY`** so the system remains usable even when strict XML formatting is unavailable.

### Prompt cache hints

The core can pass **prompt segments** to model providers so they can use prompt-caching APIs when supported. Each segment has `content` (string) and `stable` (boolean). **Stable** means the content is the same across calls for the same schema/character (e.g. instructions, format, examples); **unstable** means it changes every call (e.g. state, validation codes).

**Why this exists:** Repeated calls (e.g. message handling, batched evaluators) often send the same instructions and format while only the context/state changes. Provider caching (Anthropic ephemeral cache, OpenAI/Gemini prefix cache) can reuse tokens for the stable prefix, reducing cost and latency. The core describes which parts are stable so providers can opt in without parsing the prompt.

- **Invariant:** When `promptSegments` is set on generation params, `prompt` MUST equal `promptSegments.map(s => s.content).join("")`. **Why:** Providers that ignore segments still get correct behavior by using `prompt`; those that use segments must send the same total text so model behavior is unchanged.
- **Providers:** Anthropic uses the Messages API with `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }` on stable blocks so the API can cache those blocks. OpenAI and Gemini use **prefix ordering**: when segments are present, the prompt sent to the API is built with stable segments first, then unstable. **Why:** OpenAI and Gemini cache by prefix (e.g. OpenAI ≥1024 tokens); putting stable content first maximizes cache hits.

**Pitfalls for operators:**

- OpenAI caching only applies when the prompt is ≥1024 tokens; very short prompts will not show cache savings.
- Small or low-parameter models may not support or benefit from caching; behavior is unchanged.
- Caching is a performance/cost optimization; correctness does not depend on it.

**Pitfalls for implementers:**

- Do not mutate segment objects; always create new `{ content, stable }` objects. **Why:** Params may be passed to multiple handlers or stored; mutation can cause cross-request bugs.
- Segment order must match the order in which the prompt string is built; add an assertion that `prompt === promptSegments.map(s => s.content).join("")`. **Why:** Wrong order breaks the invariant and can send the wrong prompt to the model.
- When using segments in the API (e.g. messages or reordered prompt), ensure the final text seen by the model equals the intended full prompt (e.g. `params.prompt` or the stable-first concatenation).
- Only mark content as `stable: true` if it is identical across calls for the same schema/character. **Why:** Content that includes per-call UUIDs or changing state will never cache; mislabeling it as stable wastes cache capacity and can confuse operators.

## Core Architecture

`@elizaos/core` is built around a few key concepts that work together within the `AgentRuntime`.

### Unified Prompt Batcher

`@elizaos/core` now includes a unified prompt batching subsystem on `runtime.promptBatcher`.

Why this exists:

- Evaluators, startup warmups, and autonomous reasoning were all paying separate LLM round trips for structurally similar work.
- Batching reduces cost, queue depth, and local GPU contention by turning many small prompt calls into fewer structured calls.
- The dispatcher keeps deployment flexibility: local inference can pack aggressively while frontier APIs can trade some density for latency.

What it does:

- `askOnce()` batches startup questions into a single post-init drain when possible. Returns a promise of the extracted **fields** (unwrapped). **Why:** callers get a thenable so they can `await` or `.then()` without a callback.
- `onDrain(id, opts)` registers a section that runs on the next drain for that affinity and returns a **promise that resolves with `{ fields, meta }`** (or `null` if the section ID was already registered). **Why:** evaluators can use linear `await` + `if (result) { ... }` instead of a large `onResult` callback; same batching benefits. You can still pass optional `onResult` for fire-and-forget or recurring use (e.g. logging).
- `think()` is used by **autonomy**: when `enableAutonomy` is true, the autonomy service registers one recurring section; a BATCHER_DRAIN task in the task system drives when that affinity drains (task system owns WHEN, batcher owns HOW). **Why:** one register for "what to ask" and the same orchestration path as evaluators and startup, with the same cache and packing benefits. Autonomy keeps using `onResult` because it is fire-and-forget per drain.
- `askNow()` supports blocking audits without creating a second subsystem. Returns a promise of the **fields** (unwrapped). **Why:** same thenable style as askOnce; fallback is required so the caller always gets an object.

Result shape and errors:

- Section promises (from `addSection` / `onDrain`) resolve with **`BatcherResult<T> | null`**: `{ fields: T, meta: DrainMeta }`. **Why:** callers get both the extracted data and drain metadata (e.g. `meta.fallbackUsed`, `meta.durationMs`) in one object; `null` means duplicate section ID so the caller can branch.
- When **onResult** throws or the batcher is **disposed**, the section promise **rejects** instead of resolving. **Why:** callers can `.catch()` or try/catch for real failures; fallback-used still resolves (with `meta.fallbackUsed: true`) so "soft" failure is not an exception.
- **Generic `onDrain<T>(...)`**: pass a type param so `result.fields` is typed (e.g. `onDrain<ReflectionFields>(...)`). **Why:** avoids casting at call sites; the runtime still returns `Record<string, unknown>` from the model—the generic is for developer convenience.

Important behavior:

- Sections are idempotent by ID, so developers can register them from handlers without tracking lifecycle manually.
- The promise returned by `onDrain` (or `addSection`) **resolves once**—on the first delivery for that registration. **Why:** per-drain sections run on every drain, but the thenable is for "give me the result of this registration"; subsequent drains do not resolve the same promise again. For recurring delivery (e.g. every drain), use the optional `onResult` callback.
- Context is declarative and composable: `providers`, `contextBuilder`, and `contextResolvers` can be mixed.
- Dispatching is affinity-aware, so unrelated prompt sections are not merged into the same call just because they arrived at the same time.

Relevant runtime knobs (all `PROMPT_BATCHER_*`, read in `src/runtime.ts`):

- `PROMPT_BATCHER_BATCH_SIZE`
- `PROMPT_BATCHER_MAX_DRAIN_INTERVAL_MS`
- `PROMPT_BATCHER_MAX_SECTIONS_PER_CALL`
- `PROMPT_BATCHER_PACKING_DENSITY`
- `PROMPT_BATCHER_MAX_TOKENS_PER_CALL`
- `PROMPT_BATCHER_MAX_PARALLEL_CALLS`
- `PROMPT_BATCHER_MODEL_SEPARATION`

The prompt batcher implementation lives in `src/utils/prompt-batcher/` (`batcher.ts`, `dispatcher.ts`). The lower-level queue primitives (`PriorityQueue` / `BatchProcessor` / `TaskDrain` / `BatchQueue`) live in `src/utils/batch-queue/`.

### Task system

The **task system** is the single place for *when* scheduled work runs. Only tasks with tag `queue` are polled by the scheduler (TaskService); other tasks (e.g. approval, follow-up) are stored and executed only when explicitly triggered (e.g. choice action, or `executeTaskById`).

**Why one scheduler:**

- Recurring work (e.g. batcher drains, future cron-like use) uses the same DB, same pause/resume, same visibility (`getTaskStatus`, `nextRunAt`, `lastError`). Retry and backoff (exponential backoff, auto-pause after `maxFailures`) live in one place so we avoid infinite retry storms.

**Why queue + repeat:**

- Tasks with `tags: ["queue"]` are fetched every tick. Non-repeat tasks run when `now >= dueAt` (or `metadata.scheduledAt`) then are deleted; repeat tasks use `updateInterval`/`baseInterval` and `metadata.updatedAt` as last-run time. **Why:** One-shot "run at time X" (e.g. follow-up) uses `dueAt`; interval-based scheduling covers batcher drains and recurring use.

**Why `utils/batch-queue`’s `TaskDrain`:** several services create the same style of repeat drain task (`queue` + `repeat`, `maxFailures: -1`, interval metadata). Centralizing find/create/update/delete avoids each caller re-implementing JSON/metadata edge cases and keeps worker registration rules explicit (`skipRegisterWorker` when TaskService already owns the worker name). Implementation in `src/utils/batch-queue/`.

**Cross-runtime scheduling (three modes):**

1. **Local timer (default):** One `setInterval` per TaskService; each runtime fetches its own queue tasks every tick. **Why:** Zero config for single-process apps.
2. **Per-daemon:** Host calls `startTaskScheduler(adapter)`; one shared timer runs, one batched `getTasks(agentIds)` per tick for all registered runtimes, then tasks are dispatched to each runtime’s `runTick(tasks)`. **Why:** Multi-agent daemons avoid N DB queries per second.
3. **Serverless:** Construct runtime with `{ serverless: true }`; no timer. Host calls `taskService.runDueTasks()` from cron or on each request to run due queue tasks once. **Why:** No long-lived process; host controls when tasks run.

**Public API (TaskService):** `executeTaskById`, `pauseTask`, `resumeTask`, `getTaskStatus`, `markDirty`, `runDueTasks()` (serverless). **Why:** Operators and UIs can run, pause, resume, and inspect tasks without touching the DB directly.

The implementation lives in `src/services/task.ts` and `src/services/task-scheduler.ts`.

### Autonomy

The autonomy service lets the agent "think" and act on a schedule without user messages. It uses the **prompt batcher** with the **task system** for scheduling: when `enableAutonomy` is true, a recurring section is registered with `think("autonomy", ...)`. A BATCHER_DRAIN task for the autonomy affinity determines when the section drains; results are delivered to `onResult`, which runs the same post-LLM steps as the message pipeline (actions, memory, evaluators) via an execution facade.

Why batcher-only:

- The batcher owns "what to ask"; the task system owns "when" (per-affinity BATCHER_DRAIN tasks). One scheduling surface and one packing path. Evaluators used after autonomy runs are the same as for user messages; as more evaluators move to the batcher, autonomy benefits automatically.

### AgentRuntime

The `AgentRuntime` (`src/runtime.ts`, `class AgentRuntime implements IAgentRuntime`) is the heart of the system. It manages the agent's lifecycle, loads plugins, orchestrates the message loop, and is the central point for actions, providers, and evaluators. It is initialized with a set of `Plugin`s; foundational actions, providers, evaluators, and services ship as the `basicCapabilities` bundle (`src/features/basic-capabilities/index.ts`).

### Actions

Actions define specific tasks or capabilities the agent can perform. Each action typically includes:

- A unique `name`.
- A `description` explaining its purpose and when it should be triggered.
- A `validate` function to determine if the action is applicable in a given context.
- A `handler` function that executes the action's logic.

Actions enable the agent to respond intelligently and perform operations based on user input or internal triggers.

**Private actions.** Set `private: true` on an action to reserve it for the agent's own autonomous loop. A private action is never exposed to the planner — and is rejected by the executor as a defense-in-depth backstop — on user-driven turns; it can only be selected and run when the triggering message is an autonomous self-prompt (`content.metadata.isAutonomous === true`, the marker the autonomy service stamps). Use this for self-initiated capabilities the agent should decide to invoke on its own — e.g. minting a coin or opening a position — rather than ones a user can trigger on demand. The gate lives in `src/runtime/private-action-gate.ts`.

### Providers

Providers are responsible for supplying data and context to the `AgentRuntime` and its components. They can:

- Fetch data from external APIs or databases.
- Provide real-time information about the environment.
- Offer access to external services or tools.

This allows the agent to operate with up-to-date and relevant information.

### Evaluators

Evaluators analyze conversation data and other inputs to extract meaningful information, build the agent's memory, and maintain contextual awareness. They help the agent:

- Understand user intent.
- Extract facts and relationships.
- Reflect on past interactions to improve future responses.
- Update the agent's knowledge base.

### Database adapter

The runtime talks to persistence through the `IDatabaseAdapter` interface. Adapters (e.g. plugin-sql, plugin-localdb, InMemory) implement this contract so the same runtime code works with different backends.

**Why mutation methods return `Promise<boolean>`:** Methods such as `updateAgents`, `deleteAgents`, and `deleteParticipants` return a boolean so callers can tell success from failure. That supports error handling, retries, and UX (e.g. "Agent removed" vs "Failed to remove"). All adapters use this convention for consistency. See `packages/core/src/types/database.ts` for full JSDoc and design notes.

## Getting Started

### Initializing a runtime

```typescript
import { AgentRuntime } from "@elizaos/core";

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
  character,           // a Character (type in src/types/agent.ts; helpers in src/character.ts)
  plugins: [
    // your plugins; each contributes actions/providers/evaluators/services
  ],
  // other AgentRuntime options
});

await runtime.initialize();
```

Foundational actions, providers, evaluators, and services are available as the `basicCapabilities` bundle and its parts (`basicActions`, `basicProviders`, `basicEvaluators`, `basicServices`) exported from `@elizaos/core`. There is no `corePlugin` singleton — compose the bundles you need or rely on a higher-level package (e.g. `@elizaos/agent`) to wire them.

### Defining a custom capability

A custom action implements the `Action` type (`src/types/`):

```typescript
import type { Action } from "@elizaos/core";

export const customGreet: Action = {
  name: "CUSTOM_GREET",
  description: "Greets a user in a special way.",
  validate: async (runtime, message) => message.content.text?.includes("special hello") ?? false,
  handler: async (runtime, message, state, options, callback) => {
    await callback?.({ text: "A very special hello to you!" });
    return { success: true };
  },
  examples: [],
};
```

Register it via a `Plugin` (`{ name, actions: [customGreet] }`) passed to the runtime. Providers and evaluators follow the same pattern against the `Provider` / `Evaluator` types.

## Development & Testing

The package uses **vitest**. From the repo root:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/core test          # vitest run
bun run --cwd packages/core test:watch    # watch mode
bun run --cwd packages/core test:coverage # with v8 coverage
bun run --cwd packages/core typecheck     # tsgo --noEmit
```
