# GitHub Connector

Connect your agent to GitHub for repository management, issue tracking, and pull request workflows using the `@elizaos/plugin-github` package.

> **Note:** GitHub is registered as a **feature** plugin (not a connector) in the plugin registry. It provides GitHub API integration but is categorized under features in `plugins.json`.

## Overview

The GitHub plugin is an elizaOS feature plugin that bridges your agent to the GitHub API. It supports repository management, issue tracking, pull request creation and review, and code search. This plugin is available from the plugin registry.

> **Note:** GitHub is categorized as a feature plugin, not a connector. It does not use the `connectors.github` config pattern. Install it via the plugin registry and configure with environment variables.

## Setup Requirements

- GitHub API token (personal access token, fine-grained token, or GitHub App credentials)

## Guided credential setup (dashboard)

The fastest path is the dashboard: **Settings → Coding Agents → GitHub**. The
connection card offers two ways to connect, and either one makes every
GitHub-touching capability (issue management, workspace push/PR, repo
provisioning) work immediately — no restart, no manual env editing:

1. **Sign in with GitHub (device flow)** — shown when the agent has a
   `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` setting. The card displays a short code, opens
   `github.com/login/device`, and waits while you approve. The device code and
   the granted token never pass through the browser.
2. **Paste a personal access token** — always available. The card links to a
   pre-filled token-generation page (`repo`, `read:user` scopes).

Both paths validate the token against GitHub, persist it to the agent's local
credential store (`<state-dir>/credentials/github.json`, mode 600), and apply
it to the running agent's per-agent settings so `runtime.getSetting("GITHUB_TOKEN")`
resolves right away.

### PAT vs device sign-in

| | Personal access token | Device sign-in (OAuth device flow) |
|---|---|---|
| Owner setup | none | register a GitHub OAuth app with **device flow enabled**, set `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` |
| User steps | create token on github.com, paste it | type a short code on github.com, click approve |
| Scoping | you choose scopes/repos when creating the token (fine-grained tokens can be repo-allowlisted) | fixed `repo read:user` scope requested by the app |
| Expiry | you set it at creation | GitHub OAuth app token policy |
| Best for | single operator, precise scoping | fleets/kiosks where users shouldn't hand-build tokens |

If a GitHub action fails with a credentials error mid-task, the error message
points back at this card — connect there and retry the task.

### Vault/settings vs environment variables

Prefer per-agent settings (the dashboard card, the agent's vault/secrets, or
`character.settings`) over process environment variables:

- **Env leaks across agents.** On a multi-tenant host, `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the
  process environment is visible to *every* agent in that process — one
  agent's identity silently becomes everyone's.
- **Settings are per-agent.** A token stored via the dashboard card or the
  vault resolves through `runtime.getSetting("GITHUB_TOKEN")` for that agent
  only, and survives restarts through the agent's own credential store.
- Env still works for single-agent, single-operator installs and always wins
  over the stored credential at boot (an explicit shell export overrides the
  saved value).

> **Cloud note:** which GitHub identity a cloud-provisioned agent should get
> (per-agent bot account vs the owner's PAT vs a GitHub App installation) is a
> policy decision that is still open — see issue #15796. Until then, cloud
> agents use whatever token the operator connects via the card or the agent's
> settings.

## Minimal Configuration

```json
{
  "connectors": {
    "github": {
      "apiToken": "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
      "owner": "YOUR_GITHUB_OWNER",
      "repo": "YOUR_GITHUB_REPO"
    }
  }
}
```

Or via environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN
export GITHUB_OWNER=YOUR_GITHUB_OWNER
export GITHUB_REPO=YOUR_GITHUB_REPO
```

## Configuration Reference

All fields are defined under `connectors.github` in `eliza.json`.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `apiToken` | Yes | GitHub personal access token |
| `owner` | No | Default GitHub repository owner (username or organization) |
| `repo` | No | Default GitHub repository name |
| `branch` | No | Default branch name (defaults to `main`) |
| `enabled` | No | Set `false` to disable (default: `true`) |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` | Yes | Personal access token or fine-grained token |
| `GITHUB_OWNER` | No | Default repository owner (username or org) |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | No | Default repository name |
| `GITHUB_BRANCH` | No | Default branch (e.g. `main`) |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | No | For GitHub App webhook verification |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | No | GitHub App ID (for App-based auth) |
| `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | No | GitHub App private key PEM (for App-based auth) |
| `GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID` | No | GitHub App installation ID (for App-based auth) |

## Authentication Methods

### Fine-Grained Personal Access Token (recommended)

Fine-grained tokens are scoped to specific repositories and permissions, and they expire automatically.

1. Go to [github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).
2. Set a token name (e.g. "Eliza") and expiration (90 days is reasonable).
3. Under **Repository access**, select **Only select repositories** and pick the repos you want.
4. Under **Repository permissions**, grant at minimum:
   - **Contents**: Read (Read and write if you want the agent to push code)
   - **Issues**: Read and write
   - **Pull requests**: Read and write
   - **Metadata**: Read (always required)
5. Click **Generate token**. Copy it immediately — it starts with `github_pat_` and is only shown once.

### Classic Personal Access Token

Use a classic token when fine-grained tokens don't support the scope you need (e.g. private packages).

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**.
3. Grant the scopes you need (`repo`, `read:org`, etc.).
4. Copy the token.

### GitHub App (for teams and production)

GitHub Apps are better for team use — installations are easier to audit and can be installed org-wide.

1. Register a new GitHub App at [github.com/settings/apps/new](https://github.com/settings/apps/new).
2. Generate a private key and note the App ID.
3. Install the app into the repos or org — note the Installation ID.
4. Set `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID` in your environment or config.

## Features

- Repository management (read files, create branches, push code)
- Issue tracking and creation
- Pull request workflows (create, review, merge)
- Code search and file access
- Webhook-driven event handling (with GitHub App)

## Troubleshooting

**"401 Unauthorized" when the agent tries any action.**
Token is wrong, expired, or doesn't have the repo scoped. Re-check in GitHub settings.

**"403 Resource not accessible by personal access token."**
The token is valid but doesn't have permission for the specific action. Most common cause: you granted Contents: Read but the agent tried to write. Go back and grant Contents: Read and write.

**"Not found" when reading a repo you know exists.**
Fine-grained tokens are strictly allowlist — if the repo isn't in the list, the agent can't see it. Go back to the token page and add the repo.
