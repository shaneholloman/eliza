# Gmail Watch Connector

Monitor Gmail inboxes for incoming messages using Google Cloud Pub/Sub with the `@elizaos/plugin-gmail-watch` package.

## Overview

The Gmail Watch plugin is an elizaOS feature plugin that monitors Gmail inboxes via Google Cloud Pub/Sub. It watches for new messages and triggers agent events. This plugin is enabled via the `features.gmailWatch` flag rather than the `connectors` section. Available from the plugin registry.

> **Note:** Gmail Watch is categorized as a feature plugin, not a connector. It uses the `features` config section instead of `connectors`.
