## 0. VERIFIED FINDINGS (2026-05-24, post-execution) — supersedes §1–§6 below

Sections 1–6 were the *pre-execution* assessment and contain several wrong
assumptions. The verified state after running every model on this machine:

### 0.1 Every core model has a real, working forward pass on darwin-arm64

| Model | Path | Verified result |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| OmniVoice TTS | `omnivoice-tts` CLI (NOT llama-server) | Generates distinct designed voices. `--instruct "female, young adult, high pitch"` vs `"male, elderly, very low pitch"`. ~0.35x RTF warm. Cold start ~60s (Metal shader compile). |
| Eliza-1 ASR | FFI `eliza_inference_asr_transcribe` | WER 0.18 on short phrases, 0.46 on long (truncates >7-word OmniVoice sentences). RTF ~14x. |
| Silero VAD | `libsilero_vad.dylib` (prebuilt, `build-darwin/`) | available=true, detects speech boundaries. |
| WeSpeaker ResNet34-LM encoder | `libvoice_classifier.dylib` (built this session) | Real 256-dim embeddings. **Separates real voices: same-voice cos 0.35, female-vs-male cos 0.05, gap 0.30.** |
| pyannote-segmentation-3.0 diarizer | `libvoice_classifier.dylib` | Real SincNet+BiLSTM forward. **Detected 2 speakers at correct boundaries (734-2474ms female, 2969-4915ms male) from real mixed audio in 852ms.** |
| OWNER voice verification | `voice-profiles/` TS | 47 tests pass. Prompt-injection via transcript has zero effect; voice alone (0.33) never reaches the 0.6 OWNER grant floor. |

Current runnable verification scripts:
- `packages/benchmarks/voice/local-acoustic-eval.mjs` — **real-audio diarizer + WeSpeaker eval** through the fused inference library (Apple Silicon, no GPU runner; supersedes the removed `three-voice-e2e-real.mjs`, see §0.6 for that run's historical numbers)
- `packages/benchmarks/voice/voice-real-ci-matrix.mjs` — provisioned CI real matrix with fused library, GGUFs, generated speech, and ElevenLabs fixtures
- `packages/benchmarks/voice/owner-voice-first-run.mjs` — OWNER enroll/recognize/reject/attack
- `packages/benchmarks/voice/three-voice-scenario.mjs` — 7-turn scene, synthetic audio (superseded for real acoustics)
- `packages/benchmarks/voice/verify-kokoro-agent-voice.mjs` — **Kokoro agent voice** (ONNX) + ASR round-trip

Historical scripts removed after direct `libvoice_classifier` encoder/diarizer
exports were retired: `verify-native-ggml.mjs`,
`verify-real-voice-separation.mjs`, `verify-real-diarization.mjs`, and
`verify-enrollment-attribution.mjs`.

### 0.6 Integrated three-voice scenario (real audio, real models)

`three-voice-e2e-real.mjs` (since removed — superseded by `local-acoustic-eval.mjs`
for local acoustic numbers) ran the full loop end-to-end with no fallbacks:
2 human OmniVoice voices (Alice female, Bob male) + agent voice, merged into
one 14.8s stream, through real pyannote diarizer + real WeSpeaker encoder +
real eliza-1 ASR. The numbers below are retained as that run's historical record.

- **ASR transcripts recorded:** mean WER 0.171 (5/7 turns WER 0; 2 truncated on long clauses).
- **Should-respond: 5/5 correct** on the *real ASR text* — agent replies on "Eliza" turns (1,4,6), silent on ambient (2,5).
- **Diarizer: 2 speakers detected in every window** — real separation of 2 people on one stream.
- **Speaker re-ID:** naive per-turn cosine clustering over-segments (4 entities, not 2 — within-speaker 0.135 overlaps between-speaker 0.044-0.147 on short single clips). **Enrollment averaging fixed the historical held-out attribution run 3/3** (Alice 0.30 vs Bob 0.08; Bob 0.33 vs Alice 0.13). This is the production path (same as OWNER first-run). **Caveat:** two *same-gender* OmniVoice designs (Alice vs the agent's female voice) land close (0.36 vs 0.30) and confuse — same-gender separation needs voice cloning (`--ref-wav`) or distinct recorded speakers; gender is the strong cue. Enroll only real human speakers, not the agent's own (known) voice.
- **Agent voice via Kokoro: WORKING** (`verify-kokoro-agent-voice.mjs`). Kokoro v1.0 ONNX via onnxruntime-node + npm phonemizer + af_bella; agent lines synthesized and ASR round-trip WER 0 (short) / 0.375 mean. RTF ~7.7 on CPU. The integrated scenario can use Kokoro for agent turns and OmniVoice for the two humans.
- **Perf:** OmniVoice CLI reloads the model per call (~20s each); production must use the resident FFI TTS path (`eliza_inference_tts_synthesize`).

### 0.2 The ONE real wiring bug

`libvoice_classifier` and `libsilero_vad` are located by a resolver that
searches `packages/native-plugins/<lib>/build/` — **but that directory does
not exist**; the real path is `packages/native/plugins/<lib>/build-darwin/`
(slash, not dash; `build-darwin`, not `build`). Affected resolvers:
- `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/vad-ggml.ts`
- `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/speaker/encoder-ggml.ts`
- `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/speaker/diarizer-ggml.ts`

Fix: change the path segment to `native`,`plugins` and check both `build` and
`build-darwin`. Until then, set `ELIZA_VOICE_CLASSIFIER_LIB` /
`ELIZA_SILERO_VAD_LIB` env vars. The native forward passes themselves are
correct — this is purely library discovery.

### 0.3 Build step required (one-time)

`libvoice_classifier.dylib` ships no darwin build (only a stale linux `.so`).
Build it:
```
cmake -B packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/build-darwin \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp
cmake --build packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/build-darwin -j
```
Pure scalar C, `-lm` only, builds in under 2s. 5/7 ctests pass (1 gguf-loader
fixture failure, 1 parity test skipped without fixtures).

### 0.4 Corrected gap statuses

- **GAP-1 (multi-speaker diarization not wired):** RESOLVED. Native pyannote forward works; the `MOCK_DIARIZATION_PIPELINE` in app-core is a separate test double, but `PyannoteDiarizer`/`DiarizerGgml` run real segmentation.
- **GAP-2 (Kokoro broken):** RESOLVED. Kokoro v1.0 (`model_q4.onnx`) runs end-to-end via `KokoroOnnxRuntime` + `onnxruntime-node` (which DOES load under Bun) + the npm `phonemizer` package + `af_bella` voice pack. Verified: `verify-kokoro-agent-voice.mjs` synthesizes agent lines, ASR round-trip WER 0 on the short line / 0.375 mean (longer line truncated by ASR, not Kokoro). RTF ~7.7 on CPU (slow vs OmniVoice 0.35× — acceptable for occasional agent replies, not high-throughput). The earlier "onnxruntime-node not installed" finding was wrong. llama-server still cannot load OmniVoice GGUF (custom schema) — OmniVoice uses its CLI/FFI path.
- **GAP-3 (VAD missing from 0_8b):** WRONG — VAD was always present (all 3 formats in `vad/`). Real issue was the resolver path (§0.2).
- **GAP-7 (diarizer/encoder native lib unbuilt):** RESOLVED this session (§0.3).
- **GAP-4/5/6 (3-voice scene, OWNER verification, should-respond):** COVERED by the scripts in §0.1.

### 0.5 Honest limitation

The synthetic speech fixtures (`makeSpeechWithSilenceFixture`) use **one fixed
voice** (formants 700/1220/2600, f0 110Hz) regardless of seed, so the real
encoder/diarizer correctly collapse them to a single speaker. Meaningful
multi-speaker tests require genuinely distinct audio — use OmniVoice designed
voices (as the `verify-real-*` scripts do), not the synthetic fixtures. Earlier
"0.33 separation" numbers from the pure-JS fallback keyed on seed noise, not
real speaker identity, and are not valid.

## 2. What's Broken / Missing

### 2.1 Critical Gaps

**GAP-1: Full Multi-Speaker Diarization NOT Wired**
- `speaker_imprint_diarization_harness.mjs` explicitly reports: `"localMultiSpeakerImplemented": false`
- The diarizer GGUF exists (pyannote-segmentation-3.0-fp32.gguf)
- The TypeScript wrapper (`diarizer-ggml.ts`) exists
- But: No integration in the live voice pipeline connecting VAD → diarizer → speaker encoder → attribution
- Missing: End-to-end segment → speaker-ID assignment in production code path

**GAP-2: Kokoro TTS Broken on All Paths**
- ONNX path: `KokoroOnnxRuntime` constructor undefined (module resolution failure)
- llama-server path: `needs-build` — the fused llama-server binary doesn't include Kokoro `/v1/audio/speech` endpoint
- The Kokoro source exists in `native/llama.cpp/tools/kokoro/` but needs compilation into the server binary

**GAP-3: VAD Missing from 0_8b Bundle**
- The `eliza-1-0_8b.bundle/voice/vad/` directory is empty
- VAD exists in 2b and 27b bundles as `silero-vad-v5.1.2.ggml.bin`
- Diarization harness falls back to "no VAD" mode, skips real speech detection

**GAP-4: No Three-Voice End-to-End Test**
- The goal requires 3 voices (2 human + 1 agent) in the same audio stream
- Existing two-agent demo is synthetic only (no real audio)
- The `three-agent-dialogue` runner at `packages/benchmarks/` uses Groq (cloud) or synthetic
- No test uses omnivoice to generate distinct voices, merge them into one audio stream, and run through diarization

**GAP-5: OWNER Voice Verification Not Tested End-to-End**
- `owner-confidence.ts` and `private-challenge.ts` exist but no integration test
- No scenario testing OWNER recognition via voice profile match
- No test for security: non-owner voice attempting to get OWNER privileges
- Voice first-run flow (UI) not tested with actual audio

**GAP-6: Agent Response Decision Test Missing**
- No scenario validating when agent SHOULD respond (addressed to it) vs. SHOULD NOT (ambient conversation not addressing agent)
- The agent's "should I respond?" logic is not covered by voice-specific tests

### 2.2 Secondary Gaps

**GAP-7: Emotion Model Backend Deprecated**
- `wav2small-cls7-int8.onnx` is the int8 ONNX format
- The voice-models.ts versioning shows v0.3.0 should be GGUF-only
- The GGUF version not installed in 0_8b bundle

**GAP-8: ASR Benchmarks Missing WER on Real Speech**
- `asr-wer-real-recorded-0_8b-needs-corpus-20260516.json` says "needs-corpus"
- No standardized audio corpus for WER measurement available locally
- RTF benchmarks exist but accuracy baselines don't

**GAP-9: OmniVoice Voice Design Multi-Voice Not Tested**
- OmniVoice supports gender/age/pitch/style/emotion parameters
- No test generating multiple distinct voices with different designs
- The `OMNIVOICE_INSTRUCT` parameter for voice design not exercised in benchmarks

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Core Models (1 session)

1. **Fix VAD for 0_8b bundle** — Copy silero VAD from 2b bundle or symlink
2. **Fix Kokoro ONNX path** — Debug KokoroOnnxRuntime module resolution  
3. **Build Kokoro llama-server** — Compile `native/llama.cpp` with kokoro support via `build-omnivoice.mjs`
4. **Verify diarizer loads** — Run `diarizer-ggml.ts` with pyannote model directly

### Phase 2: TTS/ASR Baseline (Sub-agent A)

1. Run omnivoice TTS with 3+ distinct voice designs → save WAV files
2. Run each WAV through eliza-1 ASR → verify transcript
3. Measure RTF and WER
4. Run kokoro TTS with `af_bella` (female) and `am_michael` (male) → compare
5. Benchmark all voices on M4 Max

### Phase 3: Multi-Voice Scenario (Sub-agent B)

1. Build `three_voice_scenario.mjs`:
   - Voice A: `omnivoice` with female voice design (high-pitched, young)
   - Voice B: `omnivoice` with male voice design (deep, older)  
   - Agent Voice: `omnivoice` with neutral/Eliza design
2. Script: A asks question, B comments, agent responds to A only
3. Use AudioBus from `packages/benchmarks/three-agent-dialogue/runner/audio-bus.ts`
4. Merge A+B into mixed audio stream → run diarization
5. Verify agent correctly attributes turns to speaker A or B

### Phase 4: Diarization Wiring (Sub-agent B)

1. Connect: VAD → pyannote diarizer → speaker encoder → speaker imprint attribution
2. Use `diarization-pipeline.ts` in `packages/app-core/src/services/voice-profiles/`
3. Test with mixed 2-speaker WAV (alternating voices)
4. Measure DER (Diarization Error Rate) on generated speech

### Phase 5: OWNER Voice Verification (Sub-agent C)

1. Simulate first-run: capture voice samples → build embedding → store as OWNER profile
2. Test recognition: same voice → OWNER role assigned
3. Test rejection: different voice → USER role, OWNER access denied
4. Security test: attacker says "I am the owner" → voice profile mismatch → access denied
5. Integration with `resolveOwnershipRole()` in `roles.ts`

---

## 5. Quick Wins (Can Do Immediately)

1. **Fix VAD** — `cp ~/.local/state/eliza/local-inference/models/eliza-1-2b.bundle/vad/silero-vad-v5.1.2.ggml.bin ~/.local/state/eliza/local-inference/models/eliza-1-0_8b.bundle/voice/vad/`
2. **Run omnivoice TTS** — The 9b bundle has the model; need to start llama-server and call `/v1/audio/speech`
3. **Run diarization pipeline test** — Models installed in 0_8b bundle, TypeScript code exists
4. **Run voice profile emotion status** — `bun verify/voice_profile_emotion_status.mjs`

---

## 6. Benchmark Targets (M4 Max)

Based on existing results:
- Kokoro 0_8b TTS RTF: 0.066 (from existing bench results)
- LLM decode: 113 tok/s (eliza-1-0_8b)
- Average voice turn (TTS+ASR+LLM): ~937ms synthetic
- VAD frame compute: ~0.5ms median per 32ms frame (from VAD harness)

Target for 3-voice scenario:
- Total round-trip per turn: < 2s
- Diarization DER: < 15% on generated speech
- OWNER recognition accuracy: > 95% on 3+ enrollment samples
