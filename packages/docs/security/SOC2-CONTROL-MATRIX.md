# SOC2 Control Matrix — Eliza Stack

This matrix maps every in-scope Trust Service Criterion to: the binding policy in `../../POLICIES/` (POLICIES/), the code location(s) implementing the control, and the evidence collection method.

Status: **scaffolding**. Some implementation references are aspirational and tracked in `audits/PLAN.md`.

## Legend

- **Policy** — link to `POLICIES/NN-name.md`.
- **Code** — primary source path or service.
- **Evidence** — what an auditor will see / how it is collected.
- **State** — `In place` / `Partial` / `Planned`.
