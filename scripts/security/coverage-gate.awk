# coverage-gate.awk
#
# Parses LCOV output and computes per-file line coverage. Compares against a
# changed-files list and prints a summary. Exit code is non-zero only when
# enforcement is enabled (COVERAGE_GATE_ENFORCE=1) and any changed file is
# missing from the LCOV report or below the threshold (default 70%).
#
# Usage:
#   awk -v changed="$CHANGED_FILES" -v threshold=70 \
#       -f scripts/security/coverage-gate.awk coverage/lcov.info
